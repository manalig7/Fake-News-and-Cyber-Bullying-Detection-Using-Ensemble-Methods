lyrics for You Should Have Killed Me When You Had The Chance ADTR  So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes I can hear you whispering as I walk by Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew This would make them change  The only thing that's going to bother me Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends  Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?  The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  Iu2019ve read these stories a thousand times  and now Iu2019ll rewrite them all Youu2019re meddling in an anger you canu2019t control She means the world to me  so hold your serpent tongue Is a whores lies worth dying for? I'll just take my time  The only thing that's going to bother me Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends  Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?  The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done  But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) But should I... ? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) You should have killed me when you had the chance You should have killed me when you had the chance	0

Being an atheist means we dont need to believe. We choose to believe either because their is no proof or because god has done nothing for us. We may not believe in god but we do believe there is good reason to not believe he exists.  No. Being Atheist is someone who denies the existence of God. Period. And you asked my opinion so please don't argue my opinion about something I don't personally care about anyways. If you want to be athiest  then be it. If you don't  then don't. I don't care. r Its your life.	0

`-This is not ``creative``.  Those are the dictionary definitions of the terms ``insurance`` and ``ensurance`` as properly applied to ``destruction``.  If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing ``personal`` or ``creative`` about it.I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving ``Mutual Assured Destruction`` to ``talk`` for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the ``ly``.There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.

`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room. ::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then. :If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads. ::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir. :You just can't make this stuff up, Danny. ::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. I am not making things up. I am simply stating things that (no matter how inconceivable it may be) you do not know. :Stop trying to re-make the ultra-Orthodox in your own image. Its not good history. Frankly, I don't care what is on your resume. It doesn't justify writing such nonsense.  RK: Personal attacks. I will say that your intellectual arrogance coupled with your apparent ignorance do not put you in a very good light. In my professional life, I have researched and written extensively on this field, developed relationships  both working and personal  with many of the people involved, and worked on several important documentary films on the topic. I think I have a sense of what NPOV is, and a statement that the ultra-Orthodox ``hate`` the non-ultra-Orthodox just doesn't make the mark. : Is beating the shit out of non-Orthodox Jews an act of love? Is calling them ``worse than Hitler`` an act of love? Is accusing them of creating the Holocaust an act of tolerance? Danny, you can protest all you like, but you obviously so immersed in an ultra-Orthodox worldview that you can't see the forest for the trees. This is violent hatespeech, and it frightens me to see an educuated person making apologetics for it.

`Someone wrote:More recognizable, perhaps, is a type of what is generally called rock and roll called [folk rock]? or simply ``folk,`` which included performers such as [Joan Baez]?, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, [The Mamas and the Papas]?, and many others. I've tried to clarify this. ``Folk rock`` is used very specifically and is typically far more recognised by instrumentation than form. Many folk musicians of the 60s (Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs etc) sang new, topical material (which distinguished them from traditional folk musicians) but in the folk idiom (acoustic instruments, traditional arrangements and often traditional melodies.)Re: the comment about ``marketers`` in the first paragraph.

`Changed Macedonia link to Macedon; ancients didn't call their land Macedonia, and the entry we have on ``Macedonia`` isn't useful for Alexander. Should probably have an article on Macedon, and take the one sentence about Alexander out of Macedonia, maybe with a ``see also.`` I don't particularly have a problem with Macedon/Macedonia, but don't the naming conventions suggest that articles be named based on their most popular usage, rather than their most correct usage (if there's a difference)?  Perhaps using Macedonia to refer to recent history and Macedon for ancient history would work (with ``see also`` back and forth)?  BlainMy native language is Greek and I can assure you that Macedon and Macedonia is the same thing. Macedonia is the ``modern`` way to say Macedon. Maybe you should change back the link to Macedonia from Macedon. If the article about Macedonia is not informative enough you could always change it.Just a note about the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander. Those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but Alexander did something that makes me wanter if their relationship was as bad as people think today. While he was invading Asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old Aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things. The result was that Aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in Macedonia from the gifts of his student. Now, if young Alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother?  Good point.  I think Alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didn't (and which was safer) isn't all that easy.  He was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off.  I think he might have respected Aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore.

I've visited evangelical churches that have nothing recognizably churchy about them - pure entertainment (movies, football games, mime, concerts, just about anything but rites or sermons) - and it's quite intentional; and I've heard that similar things are happening in trendy Roman catholic churches although I have no experience with that.

In those cases, it can be pointed out as emphatically as one would like, that ``the Old Testament of Jesus and of the Apostles, was the Greek Septuagint; and the reason that matters in this case is because the Septuagint was translated to say yada-yada, whereas the Hebrew version is more ambiguous.``   `	1

`I cut the following paragraph, which misleads people about biology::A few points are worth clarifying about ``nature`` and ``nurture``. First, ``nature`` does not reduce to anything as simple as ``present at birth``. Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.The problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.The real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.I believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `	1

But he certainly did serve as directory of Physics Institute at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Sciences from 1914 to 1933.

Wow! Quite long dispute. I know from specialist that former Iraqi president full name was Saddam Hussein at-Tikriti. (simplifying to western people first name, second name and surname). In mid-70's he resigned from at-Tikriti because many people used this name to help their careers (they called themselves at-Tikriti) and made call him just Saddam Hussein. This specialist (arabist from Poland) told that it is right to call former Iraqi president just Saddam because this is his name, Hussein and at-Tikriti are to help not to confuse him with other Saddam's.  15:54 Apr 21, 2003 (UTC)	1

Thanks for the response. I thought that it would be along the lines of your interests because we often work on similar scopes of articles. I wish that it were because you always contribute to scholarly articles, especially ones with a socio-economic and socio-political dimension lacking in so many others, like Industrial Revolution in its present form.

That's exactly what the article needed anyway, namely an analysis of economic processes. 	1

`Corrected a couple of things: Social welfare policies most certainly don't ``mostly date to the 1980s``. It's difficult to tie them to any perticular decade.

`  Heller is a good source.Concerning the ``Irgun`` versus ``Lehi`` question you raise, the confusion is resolved thus: when Stern broke away from the ``Irgun Zvai Leumi`` (National Military Organization) he named his new organization ````Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael`` (National Military Organization in Israel).

===Deletion of a phrase ===Last week, a one-time Anon, 218.170.11.195 commented on the difference between the old and new census on the number of Taiwanese of Chinese ancestry:: The disparity in the numbers may be due to racism, the understanding in Han families that children belong to the man and the need by later governments to forge greater ethnic ties to China. [emphasis added]How does patriarchy play a role? Is it implying that Han fathers married aborginal women, whose children they had were claimed by the father and deemed by society to be father's only? This reason is not obvious and whose validity I cannot prove. It requires some elaborate explanations, but then, if so, it'd not fit in the basic intro of Taiwan. Perhaps in better fitted in Census of Taiwan or Demographics of Taiwan. And it requires serious rephrase.  22:20 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)	0

`Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? `	0
`The problem with this page, IMHO, is that it doesn't deal with INDIGENOUS people at all, but rather (for lack of a better word) PRIMITIVE people. As has been pointed out, there are many groups of people which are indigenous (whatever that means) to the areas in which they live but are not indigenous people in the sense the article is written (e.g. most of the inhabitants of the Old World!).I don't care how PC or relativist you are, there clearly is a difference between those cultures and societies which embrace and accept change from the outside and have joined the ``global mainstream``, and those which have not. As for those so-called ``indigenous people`` who have adopted modern ways, I'd make the argument that they're simply then no longer indigenous peoples (in the sense this article and the US uses the term, as misleading as it is).   05:52 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)`	1

When I shake my fist at someone on the freeway and call them an ``a__hole,`` I'm using figurative language (the figure of speech is synecdoche) without being poetic in any sense of the word.``In literal language, truth conditions work out well, while in figurative language, they may not.`` IMO the definition of terms in this sentence will be unclear to most general readers of an encyclopedia. What are ``truth conditions``? If it's a technical term, we'd better define it.Also, I moved the following to this page-== To add ==* Why would someone want to divide language into literal and figurative? What is gained thereby? (Lakoff provides some insight here.)* Why would people prefer not to view language with this divide?* How does this connect to theories of truth?``-These are all needed additions.

`Please note that your comment that ``What you are saying is that YOU have never heard of Exeter. This is your problem. Perhaps you should read [1] and enlighten yourself.

`The map availability theory is an interesting one, and worth considering. This whole thing dates to the early days of the ramblers, and the recreational interest in the landscape (as opposed to those too busy trying to live in it)On finding ley-lines, it took me a while to hunt it down, but this is a passage I remembered from John Crowley's excellent novel Ægypt: Star temples and ley-lines, UFOs and landscape giants, couldn't they see what was really, permanently astonishing was the human ability to keep finding these things? Let anyone looking for them be given a map of Pennsylvania or New Jersey or the Faraways, and he will find ``ley-lines``; let human beings look up long enough on starry nights and they will see faces staring down at them. That's the interesting thing, that's the subject: not why there are ley-lines, but why people find them...Actually I think the point of the statistical argument was that proponents quote extremely low probabilities that the alignments that they find could have arisen by chance: but out of the set of all possible alignments selected from (semi-)random points, there will be a number (perhaps a majority) of low probability ones.. ``Million to one chances turn up nine times out of ten``.   00:07 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)`	0

`== Stone-throwing incident ==I have moved the following section here. It is not that I deny it happened nor that it is relevant, but I believe it is ludicrous for to devote this much space to the incident in such a short article. I will try to research the matter and rewrite it in 1/3 the space, but personally I think it would be more useful to expand the section on his academic work, ie, Orientalism, which is much more interesting and important.   :In July 2000 Said travelled to Lebanon, where along with other Arabs he began hurling large rocks into Israel towards a group of Israeli soldiers.  Agence France Press released a photograph showing him during this attack. When asked about this event, Said told reporters that this was ``a symbolic gesture of joy``, and aimed at an empty place. Eyewitnesses claim that Said was lying; The London Daily Post reported that Said was observed hurling stones, in a group, at Israel soldiers in an Israeli watchtower.:Said was criticised for this action by the moderate Arab Press. A report in the Beirut Daily Star stated that they were disappointed that a scholar ``who has labored ... to dispel stereotypes about Arabs being 'violent'`` reversed couse, and let himself ``be swayed by a crowd into picking up a stone and lofting it across the international border.`` The student newspaper where he teaches, the Columbia Daily Spectator, commented that Said's ``hypocritical violent action`` was ``alien to this or any other institution of higher learning.`` :Several months later, in an interview with an Israeli newspaper (Haaretz English Edition, August 18, 2000) Said reversed his story, and denied his previous description. He now claims ``in fact what happened was that my son and some of the other young men were trying to see who could throw stones furthest. And since my son is a rather big fellow - he is an American who plays baseball - he threw furthest. My daughter said to me, 'Daddy can you throw a stone as far as Wadia?' and that of course stirred the usual kind of oedipal competition. So I picked up a stone and threw it.`` This latest revision is commonly held to be facetious.`	1

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. `	1

`Now that the edit war seems to have died down. I just want to add a little about privatization and free market. Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont. But atleast we do not have to use their rhethorics.  `	0

Axelrosen:I edited the technical analysis and charting page immediately after it had been merged.  Whoever did the job had linked remarks about technical with the EMH.  I then tried to make sense of what had been written.  In fact technical analysts don't talk about the EMH and woujld hardly know what it is.  It is for that reason that I wrote that they IMPLICITLY assumed (actaully without knowing it) weak form efficiency (or actually completely inefficient markets...that few people espouse belief in).  It would probably be wise to alter the text to disconnect the EMH comments from chartism as the practitioners do.King Brosby.	0
:Consider some recent actions: I helped exposed a Christian Identity neo-Nazi (and his close friend who always support him)...and not a single person believed me, even after massive amounts of incontrovertible proof were given.  Some people wrote me offline to tell me that they agreed with these statements...but none of these people were willing to agree with me on the WikiEn (Wiki-English) list. I am sad that people are so afraid of the Wikipedian group-think and smear campaign that they are unwilling to say certain things in public. Offline (i.e. in the real world), many people also agree with me on this issue. That is why they refuse to participate on Wikipedia. They think that I was nuts to participate here, because even in blatant cases of anti-semitism, the Wikipedia elite usually pretended otherwise, through self-deception, almost sterotypical pseudo-liberal stupidity, or by what we consider fairly clear examples of anti-Semitism.  :I was told, by a few professional colleagues in Jewish education, that their evalution of contributor comments led them to believe that the hostility to Jewish issues was so great that it would be impossible to talk to most people on Wikipedia about this. They warned me that if I tried to discuss these issues openly, I would be attacked as paranoid or a liar. And to my sorrow I learned that they were correct. That is why I stopped participating here.  :However, I am thinking about returning for a small number of articles, on topics that I already promised people that I would contribute to.  I had previously prepared some material to add on the Zohar and the Chosen people articles, and I don't want to leave these topics unfinihed, missing what I see as some crucial points, and what others have pointed out are obvious gaps in the articles.  	1

The cities are the same through the ages, but they have different names in different languages.

It is perhaps dangerous to defend science using the sort of naïve methodology presently described in scientific method. That methodology is, at the least, dubious. Better to point out that science is grounded in a shared, and powerful, understanding that allows us to manipulate the world in ways that no other enterprise can. The debate between post modernists and empiricists (for want of better terms) is ongoing, and it is not appropriate to pretend here that it is finished. Better to simply refer the reader to the relevant articles.  	1

`Thanks, John.# ``...Poland annexed...`` - Poland had neither the will, nor the power to annex anything. The discussed lands were given to Poland supposedly to compensate for the eastern provinces annexed in 1939 and again in 1944 by Soviet Union. Poland was the country that suffered the most as the result of WW II, both from Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, therefore any comment hinting that Poland or Poles might be even partially responsible for any consequences of the War is absolutely unacceptable.# A mention of the Duchy of Swidnica, and it's ruler - Bolko's loyalty to Poland, would be nice.# More about the diversity in the region across the ages.# Autonomy of the Polish language speaking people during the Bohemian and Austrian rule, as opposed to the forced germanization after prussian takeover, through the ban of Polish (or Silesian) language, and oppression of the catholic faith - Kulturkampf, is worth mentioning. # Discrimination of the native Silesians by the Polish government, taking place both right after the war and now, is a must.

`I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content,only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson,Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J.Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery(1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National ScienceFoundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math schoolteachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (laterlost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation ofcomplex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers frompairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives fromCLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater thanminuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standardmultiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) +(-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must actas a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying productrule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) =24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule.This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which Iinitiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math.Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The otheraxioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` SoCLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`	1

`:::Serbs from Croatia ``cleansed`` themselves in the Operation Storm 1995, which is proven beyond reasonable doubt by orders from their commander (now an ICTY inmate) Milan Martic. And, this situation had been ``rehearsed`` several times from 1992 to 1995, as the repentant Milan Babic (another ex-rebel boss and ICTY indictee) has confessed. Nobody ``drove them out``. That's the fate they themselves had chosen. The central difference lies in the fact that no Croatian military units were involved in forced ``transportation`` or similar stuff. More: during ``Lightning`` and ``Storm`` operations, large-scale negotiations had been held with the representatives of Serbian military & civilian authorities in order to persuade them to stay. To no avail. The siren call of Greater Serbia was stronger. That's the Serb way.

`Hey Seth, after my other edits yesterday, I was thinking that an epistemology section would be good. I'd say if you're up for adding that, or a metaphysics section, go for it.

`==Britain==:When the Romans took control of the largest island they called their possessions Britannia. The earlier celtic inhabitants became known as Britons and the island as Britain. Some centuries after the Romans had left, some of these Britons migrated to the near continent. About 1000 years later (i.e. by the late Middle Ages) the region they had moved to was known as Brittany, and to distinguish the island the term Great Britain was used (compare the French names Bretagne and Grande Bretagne). After the fall of the Roman Empire, the name largely fell into abeyance and tended to be used in an historical sense. Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively.Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain? Geoffrey of monmouth comes before Roman departure + some centuries + 1000 years, so his use of Britannia major (= Great Britain) is the first use of it in the article, not a revival or historical use of a name ``in abeyance``.  `	1

It was an even split with the FCI, AKC and CKC grouping the types together and the ANKC, KC(UK) and NZKC listing the six types separately.  As the Dachshund page was already in place I decided not to mess with it for now.  We could eventually do the same as with Corgi - with a generic article at Dachshund and separate articles for each of the six types.  But my worry is that the articles would simply be too similar.::All this is just my opinion of course    	1

The author of the Class D section, imo, seems to be confusing Class D amplifiers with Digital to Analog converters (DACs) - the only reason that they are considered digital is that the output devices are only ever in one of two discrete states (saturation/cut off). There is never any conversion of the input into numbers, and most of the distortion is due to the modulation, not the quantisation of the signal.That is only the opinion of an undergraduate EE student though, if anyone feels more qualified to respond, please do.-Stuart (March 22, 2004)	0

`:::Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words ``genus`` and ``species``, as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the ``monarchy`` category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   `	1

=====John, I can't add to the Nazism and socialism talk page because it's not sectioned and too long for my browser.The point is that there is a debate on whether or not nazism is a form of socialism and the only way to write an article on the matter is to outline both sides of the debate. Taking out the competing debating points, in fact, makes the article NPOV by presenting the topic as if there is one right answer. And I'm sorry, it's just ahistorical to say that conservatives opposed Nazism. Some did, but most didn't, most notably von Papen. The Nazis didn't win an electoral majority. The only way they were able to take power was with support from the centre and right.	1

`Yeah, as I said, I didn't mean to intervene in the middle of your edits, and I'm sorry about that.  As to right and left wing, I agree the terms should be used with care.  But calling the Freikorps ``right wing`` and Lenin and the Communists ``left wing`` is not a particularly careless use of the terms, as far as I am aware.  If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it.  You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing.  But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.``  At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing.  As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists.  And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all.  And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)  I also didn't revert many of your wording changes, because I think that some of them actually do do a good job of making the article less POV.  `	1

`::Anome, I wish there was a restraining order here at Wikipedia.  Zw needs a leash!  I have a problem with Zw's assassin-style terrorism in relation to me.  Zw seems to act in ways like Zw wants me wiped out from Wikipedia except a bad memory in Zw's opinion.  It is in my esteemed opinion that I am not the singular cause of Zw's mad-on.  If you were to see the material of Zw's interest by Zw's contributions, it wouldn't confuse you in the slightest why Zw's acting this way.  I am uninterested in Zw's zealous pursuits along those subjective, topical lines.  It appears that Zw is confused in this respect, and if not, believes I am still to be held punishable for my contributions to Zw's interest-oriented articles, that Zw believes are errors without redemption for some reason.  I didn't know this would happen and didn't want it to happen, so as you can surmise, Anome, I didn't contribute to those articles with any malicious intent, especially in Zw's direction.  I didn't even know this Zw character existed until I was assaulted by Zw with some kind of Puritannical zeal.  I felt like I was on trial!  Regardless, this is not Zw's site!  I will not fight Zw for the usage of this site!

:::::Can you direct us to some hard figures which tell us that it wasn't a (ethnically) predominantly Polish village? Ethnicity has to be separated from that unquestionable fact, that it was a Polish village in the meaning that Poland was given (i.e. de jure, although not accepted by the Weimar Republic–the Third Reich) and exercised (i.e. de facto) souvereignty before the invasion.

4/28/04: Tom Ruen here. I edited the IRV page today, added a second for special cases including rules to break ties. I'm not sure if it is appropriate for the level of article, but it definitely was a vital point missing from the existing article. That is, tie-breaking consideration is vital, but I also included optional rules for quickly eliminating many weak candidates on the first round. Some may object to this approach, although in reality it is very difficult for different elimination rules to affect the winner.You can always imagine examples where a weak first round candidate wins, but usually it takes core support AND Compromise appeal to win and few candidates survive merely on compromise appeal.Examples include:Round 1) A=38%, BD=29%, CD=16%, D=9%, ED=8%Round 2) A=38%, BD=29%, D=17%, CD=16%Round 3) A=38%, D=33%, BD=29%Round 4) D=62%, A=38%Here a 4th place, 9% supported candidate wins IRV on a cascade of transfer votes, always avoiding last place.Imagined elections like this are actually the biggest fear from people happy with plurality, that some voters can offer 2,3,4,5 votes to affect the winner while others only get 1 vote.The reality is that IRV retains the power of the two-party system to thrive because when there are 3 strong parties, voters can't safely vote for a favorite if that favorite isn't also likely to be ranked highly on votes supporting the candidate they hope to eliminate.First round rules that immediately eliminate a bunch of weak candidates at once help reduce fears that IRV helps weak parties.-	0

`Matthew Stannard, an expert of the English language, who constantly criticizes my use of English, interprets in his latest edit ``capable human`` as a ``human deemed to have the capabilities of humanity``. In what dictionary did you find such definition? The word ``capable`` has much more exact meaning, what is widely known to every educated person, in 1913 public domain Webster the first definition is ``Possessing legal power or capacity; as, a man capable of making a contract, or a will``. The capable person must have enough mental powers and ability to think to make a contract or will, what this means is legally very well determined what this means. Old people who are going to make a will are sometimes asked questions like who is the prime minister of his/her country, to find out whether he/she is mentally able, and carefully checked that every sentence is what he/she really wants. The other definition is ``Possessing adequate power; qualified; able; fully competent; as, a capable instructor; a capable judge; a mind capable of nice investigations``, but these are mostly the meanings for specific cases (like instructor or judge, not ordinary human). But not ``deemed to have the capabilities of humanity``.  `	1

`:::Actually, John, I didn't complain about the color at all. -)  I do think, though, that if someone feels a color is unattractive, saying ``we needed to choose a unique color and we did`` isn't really addressing the issue  although I think you're right that infoboxes are generally ugly.

`I was sad to see that you're going to be away for the next week, because as you're coming back, I will be leaving for the summer after that.  I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do.  It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great.  By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth.  Unfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work.  It is a subject which should be purely history.  The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened.  We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.``  Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise.  They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  This is just who they are.  They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.At the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either.  It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews.  It is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic.  My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  And yes, this group has a following.  The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.  I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.I wish you the best of luck.   `	1

Romanian is very different from Dalmatian, so they probably developed in distant regions. This suggests that Romanians could not have come from the western part of the Balkans (including Albania). - I think that this argument should be entirely removed as it definitelly is not argument against theory of migration from south, but barely from Dalmatia (nobody claims that Vlachs arrived from Dalmatia). It is just irrelevant. On the same basis Dalamiatian could be replaced by Italian. 	0

`===Plautus satire's irresponsible comments are those of a crackpot.===Plautus satire's comments are idiotic nonsense. I have refereed papers for five mathematics journals, and my published papers have been refereed (and some unpublished ones that I submitted). Obviously history is consulted; obviously proof-checking is not the main point of refereeing; obviously novel ideas are examined in the context of accepted notions. To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?Plautus satire's comments are those of a crackpot.  `	1

:I'd say you like Nintendo too much. ;):It's a good idea, now I think about it. I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start.  	0

`== IPA - what ==I read the main page of the article on IPA.On the plus side it is clear.On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```	1

* The article is not quite correct. Decoherence times can range from picoseconds to seconds, depending on the physical system used to implement quantum computer. I think the statement about one nanosecond refers to a different physical system than the one used to build 7 qubit computer.

`:::I feel like you're making the mistake of assuming I'm an anarcho-capitalist. I'm not, particularly. Nor am I unaware that both Rand and the Libertarian party are wary of the label anarchist - just as wary as many left anarchists are of anarcho-capitalism. It's an uneasy relationship. The article should describe that. But the relationship is there - plenty of people accuse Rand of being an anarcho-capitalist, regardless of her denials of that fact, for instance. And plenty of people accuse the Libertarians of that. I mean, I think the umbrella label ``anarchism`` is a problematic one in a lot of ways - particularly in how so many groups simultaneously want to claim the label and avoid the label. I think the article needs to make the dissent and controversy surrounding the word itself clear. And any evidence I've offered in this debate should be taken as evidence of exactly how unclear the word is.  `	0

Also, I've seen ``Jerusalem Acres`` and if this is the headquarters of a 30,000 member group, then they have very little regard for, and very little per capita investment in, their headquarters, and this would certainly make them most atypical Pentecostals.

== The source of legislative authority ==The opening sentence is wrong. It saysIn the politics of the United Kingdom, legislative authority (that is, the power to make laws) is vested in Parliament . . . Incorrect. Legislative authority is vested in The Queen-in-Parliament, ie the participation of the monarch and the two houses. Unless the Queen Assents to a Bill, it cannot become law. In fact no monarch since Queen Anne with a Militia Bill in I think 1714 has declined to grant Assent. But Assent is still a legal requirement. Legislature authority exists only through The Queen-in-Parliament. Executive authority only exists through The Queen-in-Council with the cabinet exercising executive  power as a committee of the (Privy) Council. (That's why every minister must be a Rt. Hon, ie a member of the Privy Council.) So this article contains a fundamental mistake in its opening sentence.

`I disagree with the hard-and-fast division into ``English`` and ``non-English`` in the Billion and Trillion (which is too definite IMO) articles, (but agree the accepted Wikipedia value should be the US one). Here is why.My Collins English-German dictionary, third edition, purchased in England 1997, has this entry:Trillion n (Brit) Trillion f; (US) Billion f.Now the Trillion referred to is the German for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and Billion is the German word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes.My few German acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the British and American (US) usage of ``Trillion``. Similarly for Billion. Also I did once hear an English-speaking person use ``milliard``, I had to ask them what it was! They (a well educated but non-British person) thought it was a common English word.My Cassell's English-Italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way:Billion Bilione (English, 1,000,000,000,000; Amer. 1,000,000,000)Similar distinction for Trillion. Neither divides the usage into ``English`` and ``non-English``, speaking or otherwise.Admittedly current usage in the United Kingdom is either confusion or has adopted the American (US) usage. This has certainly been the case in the financial industry. I was taught the 'old' British usage of both terms in a school run by Americans in a British colony (helps to pass the British exams).The www.unc.edu link in Talk:Trillion above explains this, so I feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. I tend to clarify when speaking English to well-educated non-British Europeans(who are aware of the problem with Billion and Trillion), as to exactly which I am using (``American`` or ``British``) to make it clear.Having said all that I'm not sure what's best: American and non-American; English and non-English; British and American (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard?- |  11:06, 2004 Jul 21 (UTC)`	0
: It might be worth mentioning that according to tradition, Ignatius was a young child and among the crowds who heard Jesus' preaching.

`== I didn't think that mattered since AndyL by virtue of invoking the ``protect`` on John Kerry must obviously be either an AKA for another user (ie; phoney account for doing dirty deeds) or simply LYING about being unavailable until September 15th.Even so, forgive me for not knowing that maximum curtesy must be afforded evn to those WHO CONSPIRE to lie and cheat.In the future, I shall be more careful! `	1
`:::No, the ``problem`` is that you choose to infer the worst possible motives from any inconsistencies in Kerry's record, then assert the criticism as incontrovertible truth, and dismiss anyone who disagrees with you as being a ``Kerry sycophant`` or of whitewashing your self-proclaimed truth. Should the inconsistencies be mentioned? Certainly, if they are substantive. But different conclusions can be drawn from such inconsistenicies and we need to clearly distinguish between speculative conclusions and bare facts. ≠ : What about the link to ABC News and NY Times stories? Both of those sources confirm a set of facts that is different from what Kerry tells us is so... Alos, if my writing style offends you, why don't YOU write the new blurb, but this time INCLUDE the links to the articles which the others kept deleting out from under me....?:Oh and by the way, it's only your supposition that I choose to infer the ``worst``. As a matter of fact, by proclaiming my view to be the ``worst`` you betray your BIAS that anyone who highlights Kerry faults is somehow bad or wrong. What if it turns out that I am right about Kerry... that he has changed his story - that he is covering up for a guilty conscience, then what? Is it still the ``worst`` to believe something that's true?: Additionally, I can turn your comment around and ask, why is it that YOU prefer to believe the ``best`` about Kerry. Credulity does not impress me as a hallmark of a good editor. Frankly, if you can't see the glowing pro-Kerry tone of the total article, you are not very perceptive.: Not only that, but the disputed sections: 'Medal-Toss' and '1971 VVAW MTG', in the forms they stand now, are extrremely tilted in favor of Kerry. In particular, the VVAW secion is so chopped and convoluted in it's strain to only allow in quotes that help Kerry, that it's farcical.: You do see that, don't you?: `	1

While you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not.  In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa.  Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers. 	1

* Yes, that was rather hasty of me -) I like the idea of having some standard clip art to use; it'd give a nice level of consistency to crypto articles. The reference site you gave me has good ones; I especially like the meat grinder for hash functions. John Savard's site looks like a wonderful resource - we should get him into Wikipedia! The M-209 looks like it could be a great challenge, but it'd likely require a lot more reference material than is readily available on Google. Ideally, I'd have a replica sitting next to me to model from; I'll peek around the web and see if I can turn up anything useful, though. If you know of any books I might find at the local library that would aid me, let me know.

`:I'm backing this up with an argument, so I don't expect that you will revert these changes, based on your statement above.:I take issue with your position that the standard contemporary manner in which Latin is rendered is ``inaccurate.`` In addition, I don't believe that this is ``support[ing] the fiction that letters such as U existed, or that lower-case letters were used in Latin.``:Any Latin textbook, as well as my copies of Latin histories and poetry in Latin are all rendered with the v/u distinction (but not with j's, and not with macrons over the vowels outside of textbooks) and with lowercase letters, capitalization for the beginning of sentences and proper nouns, and with basic punctuation. It would be counterproductive and nonstandard (and not just for English text with the periodic Latin phrase thrown in now and then) for us to decide that any use of lattin must be in the 24 letter alphabet and in all caps. :And, by the way, I don't think it's very good form to set terms that must be met by others or else you plan to revert the article, since this isn't your article, Chameleon. :Thanks, | `	1

Another Nazi writer, Michael Freund, wrote that Napoleon was the only real revolutionist in 1848. Still another German National Socialist, K. H. Bremer, realized that Napoleon found the real motivating force of revolution in the social question rather than the constitutional question of the republicans of 1848. ``His great aim was to establish a political system based upon the unity of all classes and of all interests in France``.

`Something I wanted to clarify about my last edit:I simply had a problem with the original post since it wasn't accurate. Gas chambers were specifically built for exterminating the groups mentioned in my edit. Jehova's witnesses and homosexuals were put into concentration camps, and surely mistreated beyond any measure conceivable to us. The fact remains though, that they presented a normal, and small portion, of those prisoner populations, and were not treated different than the rest of the prisoners. Jews, Sinti and Roma were people the Nazis specifically targetted for extermination as a people. Later on there wasn't even imprisonment for these people, they were simply transported to the death camps.A Jehova's witness could have saved its life by denouncing its community's faith and agreeing to be drafted to the Wehrmacht, a choice Jews didn't have. But this isn't my point and I'm not suggesting they should have done that.But the fact I want simply to put out by my edit, is:I've read about the Holocaust and the Euthanasia operation, I've read about the concentration and death camps, and the SS, Gestapo and SD ``security`` apparatus, but I didn't read about Homosexuals or Jehova's witnesses being specifically targetted for extermination by gas as distinct groups, maybe still as a part of the prisoner population, but not specifically.

`I'm a bit confused about this.  As I understand it, the Bohr compactification can be defined using either only Hausdorff compact groups (what some people simply refer to simply as compact groups) or quasi-compact groups (what some other people refer to simply as compact groups, unfortunately).  In the latter case, the homomorphism iota will be injective, thus iota(G) is a dense subgroup of H which is algebraically isomorphic to G, but carries a coarser topology in general.  I am not aware of a simple characterisation of those groups for which G is isomorphic to iota(G) as a topological group, but I'm sure there's a list of sufficient conditions around.I suppose that the usual construction of the Bohr compactification is something along the lines of ``the closure of the diagonal in the direct product of all compact groups in which G maps via a continuous homomorphism with dense image``?  That might be easy enough to include in the article, but so far I've not actually stumbled across an actual construction, except in the abelian case. `	0

And, of course, as is typical of your tendency to act as if you and only you have any understanding of Wikipedia etiquette and principles, you do so in the name of ``collegial spirit``.

`==Voting policy VfD, plus should this recreated article be speedied or VfD'd?==Geogre, I think you mentioned somewhere on VfD, to Anthony if I remember right, that it was against policy to simply go down the list and add Keep or Delete (well, generally just Keep) to the discussions — that you're supposed to give reasons. Do you know where I can find this policy? I'd like to point another user to it, Dittaeva, who goes on major monosyllabic keep sprees from time to time.Also, sorry to bother you with this, but is there any reasonable way of accessing a VfD debate that is as old as Jan 2004? Anthony talked in the current Hubert Dreyfus debate about this being ``worse than when Sidney Morgenbesser was listed here and deleted.`` For a deleted article, Sidney Morgenbesser was surprisingly bluelinked, I thought, so I went look. Oh, my, what a terrible article. Consists of unpleasant anecdotes and fake references. The subject is a professor  with writer's block. Anyway, the point is, it was put up for deletion 23 Jan 2004, subsequently deleted, and then recreated in  August 2004 (as a stub, by Gzornenplatz.) Anthony added material to it on 15 August. So I wanted to put it up for speedy, but the relevant criterion says ``reposted content that was deleted according to Wikipedia deletion policy`` can be speedied, and how can I tell what the content was? The recreated article probably doesn't in fact technically speaking have the same content, since everybody called the old one ``vanity`` (there's a maybe incomplete record of the Januaray voting on User_talk:Anthony_DiPierro#Stop_the_vanity_insanity|this]] subpage of Anthony's), and the new one is much weirder than that. Oh, look, a learned cunt joke by Christopher Hitchens, how delightful.Anyway. I wanted to see the Jan voting for myself — Anthony doesn't claim that the copy of it  on  his page is complete — so I tried to burrow back through the huge VfD archive that was created in  May, but it broke when I was about halfway. So that was a wasted half-hour. -( There's got to be an easier way. Or maybe not?Anyway, good morning George. I shouldn't be doing this, I (despairingly) have other things to do. Urgent things. OK, today I'll  list Anthony's baby Sidney Morgenbesser for either speedy or VfD (yes, I will, if it's at all possible, i. e. if you have any answers for my questions above), and cleanup Reverse sexism and read that urgent dissertation chapter. Yep, those are the things I'll do. I just hope I don't get any more long screeds about vandalism and IP's and schools and stuff from sv.wiki, I can't afford to be everlastingly typing to those guys.  `	0

::Have to disagree with Mcarling here.  Hagelin was supported by large factions within the Reform Party, most prominently that Mangia fellow and Lenora Fulani, because of their (in my opinion, unwarranted, but that is irrelevant) desperation to avoid Pat Buchanan's nomination.  When I voted in Illinois, John Hagelin was listed on the ballot as Reform, whereas Buchanan was listed as Independent, because the state party refused to go along with (the larger of the two factions of) the national party and supported Hagelin.  The Hagelin faction made Mangia party chair, which can hardly be seen as an outside takeover, because he was already an officer of the party. -  	0
`:I agree that we should be consistent.  There is probably a subtle difference between the ``x effect`` and ``x-electricity``, so we need to record both forms somehow.  I would say that the ``x effect`` is an abstract concept meaning ``the process by which e.g. squeezing a crystal creates electricity``, while ``x-electricity`` is a concrete thing, the electricity that you get as the result of the effect.  I think this means that the title of the article should be the ``x effect``, as you said above, but let's acknowledge the existence of the ``x-electricity`` form somewhere in each article.   `	0

Um ... Suppose A has a short simple proof using the Riemann hypothesis, and a short simple proof not using the Riemann hypothesis.  If the Riemann hypothesis is hard to be (as appears to be the case), then wouldn't the short simple proof of A not using the Riemann hypothesis make the proof of A accessible to those who haven't worked through the proof of the Riemann hypothesis?   And might it not be important for that reason?  	0

Ardent nationalism basically sums up every nation I can think of on the face of the planet at present.  It makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  The PRC does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  Mysticism is missing from official Chinese pronouncements too.  Also missing is the stated goal of said society.  Left Totalitarian regimes like China see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  Allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of China (market socialism).  Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category.The main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.  Unions have this right in China today, to a limited extent, as in the U.S to a limited extent.  On an economic basis, Germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the U.S, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions.Unless I can be swayed from this line of thought, and I am open to it, I will mercilessly edit out grouping the PRC as fascist.   	0

`:: Dante, I agree that it is the use of the word that constructs a POV.  Of course, in a technically accurate sense either word would work, but we would then be blind to the inherent emotional connotations in each example.  To gay activists, ``disruptive`` is connotating disapproval with the decision, as we normally use ``disruptive`` in a negative sense.  Important, to people with more traditional values who view marriage as necessarily between a man and a woman, improperly connotates a sense of approval and puts the decision in a positive light.  It is not only the content but the form of the message that is able to contain POV.  `	1

`Ok, I retract my claim about British men's feet above!English Customary Weights and Measures by Russ Rowlett describes a plausible origin whereby the natural foot (of around 9-10 inches) was initially used and 'evolved' to around 12 inches due to the length of 12 inches being a convenient multiple and subdivision of other lengths used at the time.Apparantly, before the foot was standardised people used three different lengths:* a foot of 13 inches made from two shaftments of 6.5 inches each,* a foot equal to 12 inches,* a ``natural foot``, Latin: pes naturalis, of about 9.8 inches has these tidbits about the measure:* the traditional Danish foot, equal to about 12.365 inches or 31.41 centimeters.* early civilizations of the Middle East had a longer foot, roughly 30 centimeters * a Greek foot is at about 30.8 centimeters (12.1 inches)* a Roman foot at 29.6 centimeters (11.7 inches)* Swedish fot aka the Stockholm foot, equal to 11.689 inches or 29.69 centimeters* German fuss came in several versions:** Viennese fuss was 12.444 inches (31.608 cm),** Rheinfuss (Rhine foot) was 12.357 inches (31.387 cm)** Bavarian fuß was 29 cm (11.41 inches)* French pied had several lengths, the best known being the royal foot (pied de roi) of 32.48 cm* Italian pie varied, 29.8 cm was one common length, but Venice used 34.8 cm and Bologna 38 cm* Spanish pie was the traditional foot of Spain and:** in Spain was about 27.86 cm (10.97 in)** in Argentine was 28.89 cm (11.37 in)** in Texas was 11 1/9 inches or 28.22 cmFinally, in 1869 Benjamin Gould measured the feet of the Chinese Terracotta Army, and found the average foot length was 25.6 cm without shoes (10.07 inches) and 27.7 cm with shoes (10.9 inches)- |  22:42, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)`	0

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, but that's besides the point.I agree: the element phosphorus is bound to be looked up more often than Phosphorus meaning Venus and so that article should take priority (in terms of where the user is taken when they search). However, Wikipedia is not designed to be used purely by Wikipedia editors or those clued up with its conventions (nor those willing to take the time to discover them), but by anybody who wants quick and helpful access to a topic. Is such a person likely to expect to find a footnote at the bottom of the element article - I certainly don't think so. I would have thought such a person would give up at that point and look elsewhere. I don't think such a person would expect the topic they're searching for to be a footnote to something entirely different. However, if the 'dab' (is that an official term?) is at the top of this article, this certainly isn't a problem.I think it's poor practice - even if it is a general practice - to place disambiguation notices (I don't see why their 'significance' is a factor; either they're so insignificant they don't merit an article, or they do and hence shouldn't be hidden away) at the bottom of articles, since this makes the task of the user so much harder, whereas surely an encyclopedia should strive to make access to information as easy as possible.How relevant the links to the page are I'm unsure: I would have thought many people access information by entering search terms, rather than coming from a different page, and so will not have the clarification of the article's name you seem to imply. 	0

`|condo]] to prevent unecessary redirects? - , 2004-04-10t01:00z-Not sure the recent edit changing Tyler from ``Anarchist`` to ``Nihilist`` is accurate. Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  ==Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe==Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)...and the guy's name was Joe.This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original ``Joe's XXXXXX`` author?: The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. ``Joe`` is changed to ``Jack`` in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  ::I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article ``I am John's Brain Tumour``, from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824.

The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet ``Joe``s I found were two 1974 videos  from ``Pyramid Films``. I found that ``Pyramid Media`` credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with ``Joe``? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z::: It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use ``Joe``. Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  ==Tyler section==We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section.

Also a recent Guardian interview.   ==Movie & Book Balance==As I mentioned above at the end of the Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe section, the article is ``biased`` towards the movie (that is, the info for the film is treated as being the primary source instead of the book), and needs to be balanced equally for the book. I have fixed a recent re-write of the plot section (which made it even more biased in favor of the film), but more work could be done to balance the article.

How can references in an encyclopedia to a generally accepted authority on a subject be irrelevant? While you may consider the book POV it is generally accepted among scholars as being authoritative. Can you see that is what allows it and material covered in it to be included in a reference work. The relevations of Khrushchev and Solzhenitsyn are also generally considered to be significant. You seem to feel that simply casting unverified aspersions on a source is sufficient to support exclusion of the material from Wikipedia. Don't you see that simply saying bad things doesn't change the underlying general acceptance by scholars of the material? As to Conquest's representations being exposed, it is generally accepted that in the main they were affirmed.Simply labeling something POV does not justify its removal from a referance work which has a NPOV policy which contemplates inclusion of multiple points of view, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Can't you see that inclusion of your point of view is dependant on allowing other points of view to also be included?LIkewise describing the point of view of revisionist scholars of communism is simply a description of a tendency of scholars of a certain school of communist scholarship  and is backed up by a specific reference which dicusses the subject at length.

The comment that modern languages use zero-indexing is somewhat misleading, because it isn't because of technical merits, but because of the popularity of C. It's no problem for the compiler to convert the one-indexing preferred by humans (or indeed most any indexing) to the zero-indexing used in the machine code. However, since C used zero-indexing and became so popular, most programmers are used to it. That's probably the reason it's used in most later languages.	0

`:Rhino, apparently, is  a by-product of Netscape's abandoned ``Javagator`` project that also produced Grendel; both are related to Mozilla in that they have been continued as open source projects under the auspices of mozilla.org, but it looks to me like Mozilla itself uses the C-based SpiderMonkey for its JS engine.:I certainly think Thunderbird is misplaced here; in fact, I think the ``sub-projects`` and ``spin-off browsers`` sections need reorganisation, and possibly merging - certainly they should be next to each other, rather than with other sections in between.

I don't think we can leave out the EU entirely, Eurozone or otherwise - it's an important part of current politics and economics.  So I think we should add Eurozone, referred to as EU or as Eurozone, with a footnote explaining that the EU on the whole is in flux, but the figure is accurate-as-possible for the Euro countries.

:Good to know your profession. I like working in a multidisciplinary team. After beavering away at the change in categories I think I upset one of the people looking after the psychology category who went through redoing their categories. It would be nice if we could work together on this project to achieve a sort of mini psych textbook. I think that would also help those who currently take a rather oppositional approach to find that we don't have three heads and aren't out to harm them. I can already see some of this mollification occurring with some contributors. Still my bias is to add to the clinical psychiatric area since this is my field.

`While I want to distance myself from the last statement by VMORO, which I would classify as rude, I can't help pointing out to you, Crculver, that you seem to have misunderstood what grammars and books have to say (or they themselves are inexact). That dialect is certainly Macedonian in the geographical sense of the word. However, if we take modern Bulgarian and Macedonian as a starting-point, the dialect has many more traits of Bulgarian than of Macedonian.You seem also to forget that it is politics that defines what is a language and what is a dialect and which dialects belong to a certain language, not vice versa. As regards the Slavic dialects of Macedonia, we have an almost universal acceptance of them as Bulgarian until 1918, then they become viewed as Serbian by most scholars, and we have actually started regarding the name ``Macedonian`` as a linguistic and not only geographical term since 1945. Quoting the synchronical aspects of a question is of not much of a use when you lack any knowledge about its diachronical development. `	1

== Parentacide ==Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.	1

== Middle Chinese Influence ==I was wondering what is the V+ and the V- in Middle Chinese mean or where it came from.  I have done research on Minnan hua and they don't seem to always map to Cantonese in a few tones, perhaps they are confused by the different tones.  In some ways, I think Vietnamese is even closer to Cantonese than Minnan in terms of tones.  It almost maps to each one exactly.  The 2nd tone in Cantonese usually has the ? accent in Vietnamese and the 5th tone always have the ~ tone on top of the vowel.Also, Vietnamese preserved some of the NG initials that seem to be dropped from Cantonese, eg.  ren2 (mandarin) ->  jan4(cantonese), but it has the ng inital in Hakka, Toisanese, and Vietnamese.Cantonese doesn't distinguish between teacher/lion and poem.hakka/viet su  (sai in minnan i think) teacher/lion and   si  poemBut there's closer tongue curling relationship between Vietnamese and Mandarin.  (Possible tongue curling in older Chinese?  or Manchu influence?)shi  goes to th, suand all si go to t or szh goes to  chi, trz  goes to t or tychi goes to xi, tr, si   (no real pattern)c   usually t  but some exceptions to tu or thuAlso, it seems that most (if not all) 2nd tone x, zhi, z initials in Mandarin has a hard ending (-k -p -t) in Cantonese.The hard endings -k -p -t is an element from older Chinese.  -h also in Minnan.	0

:The idea behind the nicotine patch is to deliver sufficient nicotine to your bloodstream to help alleviate physical withdrawal symptoms.  You won't get the same spikes in your nicotine level that you get with cigarettes, but you shouldn't have major physical withdrawal symptoms.  With the patch, the hardest part is getting over the habitual and psychological addiction of nicotine.  :Most of the patch systems allow the user to step down around week 6, going from 21mg/day to 14mg/day to 7mg/day.  Tapering the dose like this should allow for a smooth landing when you're done smoking and make physical withdrawal symptoms unlikely.  Dreams are a relatively common side effect from the patch, at least from me.  	0

`Text from parallel article Anthony Ashley Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, reformatted to wrap properly but with typos intact. This reads like an old article from The Children's Encyclopedia, but I don't know if that's where it came from:Piccadilly Circus is the centre of London where many streets meet. In the middle of the Piccadilly there is a small island of stone, and on the island there is a statue called Eros. Eros holds a bow and arrow, and leans forward as if he is flying over London.On the steps below him women used to sit with baskets of violets and snowdrops, or bunches of pink carnations and tight little rosebuds.All around are buses and lorries, and taxis and cars coming from north and south and east and west.Day and night the busy London traffic swirls round the small, stone island, and day after day people hurry past on their way to shops and theatres and staions and offices.Everyone knowws Eros. Taxi drivers look up at him and say,``Ah,Eros!Here we are at Piccadilly!``CHildren, holding tightly to their mothers' hands as they cross the road, try to catch a gimpse of him between the rows of traffic. But no one seems to have time to go up the steps, and read the words that are written below the statue. Many people, though they know Eros so well, don't know at all why he is there.He is there to remind them opf a story about a man called the Earl of Shaftesbury, who spent his hole life heping children.`	0
`== Condoleezza Rice censorship ==Hello Jewbacca. I am writing to inform you that I have some issues with your edits to my contribution to the Condoleezza Rice article. Although you claim that I ``poison the well with unneeded POV implications,`` I would argue that your ambitious language leaves too much open for interpretation and lets Dr. Rice off the hook. Having a NPOV doesn't mean censoring controversial ideas. For example, you removed ``criticized`` from the line ``Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for her boss...`` You make it sound like perhaps it is a good thing that She was out stumping for Bush instead of protecting the homeland. In addition, you removed another line I added that spelt out that there is a ``controversial`` link she perpetuates between Iraq and September 11th. The fact that this is even open for interpretation is beyond me. I believe my additions were in line with the NPOV policy and I have replaced them. It concludes with the actual quote so readers can pose their own stance. I am open to suggestions of maybe a better way to word my feelings on this topic. Please let me know.  `	0

When we have the Homeopathy article explaining every single concept and aspect of homeopathy, except for only two short and simple definitions explained somewhere else, both of which can be written as single paragraphs, which are both referenced only in one paragraph of the main Homeopathy article, then it seems rather obvious that those paragraphs should be included in the main article itself. Note that besides the List of homeopathic remedies there are only two articles with “homeopathic” in the title: Homeopathic repertory and Homeopathic proving. Every other concept is explained in Homeopathy. Their what links here pages show that they are needed for only one purpose: to explain one paragraph of Homeopathy article, the first paragraph of Homeopathic remedies section.

The USS is a formal designator meant to show commissioned US Navy ships. This is the second time I have seen this done on Wiki.

I listed the article at cleanup because I think there is good content there, but it needs to be cleaned up.  At the first read, I immediatly got the impression that the article was written by a fan, and that the text didn't flow as well as it could because too much detail and too many quotes of more or less relavancy were included in the narative.  You seem to resist the editing of the article by others, reverting the article atleast 6 times in the last two hours.  This is not constructive.  If others choose to edit an article, it is because they want to make the article better, either by adding more detail, or by making the existing detail easier to find or understand.  We're all here to build a better encyclopedia, and sometimes a better encyclopedia is built by tightening up content so that it is presented in a clearer, more consise manner.

Since you're in the area why don't you go and check - I haven't been up there for about 18 months so things may have been cleaned up, but it didn't look too hopeful since it has been in that state for at least the last ten years. I'd check myself but I actually reside in Australia, so a quick trip is not really feasible right now. If I'm wrong I'll be more than happy to retract my statement, but since the problems appear to be somewhat entrenched, I'm not too hopeful. The area I'm thinking of in particular is the section of Livingstone Walk between Henry Wells Square and the main residential section - there was a major park there that is now closed and unquestionably surrounded by barbed wire. Further on is The Dell which when I visited last was strewn with houshold rubbish and used syringes. I don't think the evidence of my own eyes counts as 'POV'. As for the implication that I might simply be lying about this - why would I want to do that? These places are not the only examples - a tour of the area on foot will confirm what I'm suggesting. As for the CCTV info, it may be true, but it isn't actually very interesting, nor is it worded in a way which makes much sense. Read the sentence again - it does not tell you anything unless you already know what it's meant to be saying. If it can be reworded to say something interesting it might be worth keeping. (Since the UK now seems to be infested with surveillance systems, I don't think that singling Hemel out is really worth a mention). 	1
`:Let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference I include below.::Prime Minister Blair is known in Britain as well as the United States for his personal closeness to US President Bush. The two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with Blair going against the Labour party as well as the majority of British citizens. In May, he backed the controversial Israeli withdrawal plan for the Gaza Strip, a radical departure from traditional British politics toward the region, and a move that put the British government in the position of being the only major nation besides the US to support it. He acquiesced to American requests in October to send Scotland's prestigious Black Watch battalion to Baghdad. Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.:The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.:The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others. :The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it.  `	0

`==Video Poker==Video Poker machine payout tables only represent a theoretical payout percentage. The vast majority of gamers cannot achieve that payout percentage because they do not play correctly.It is essential to draw correctly depending on the content of each dealt hand, and there are strategy tables devised by computer which determine how to do so, depending on the payout table. (Hence you need different strategy tables for different payout tables!)My ambition is to add such strategy tables to the Video Poker article, but I can't just copy-and-paste such strategies from an existing book due to copyright. To get around that problem, I have an off-the-shelf analytical program that allows the creation of strategy tables based on a weighting of difficulty vs. accuracy. These tables are slightly different than the published ones, but still accomplish the desired positive payoff.If you're interested in getting a good feel for this, there is a training program called ``WinPoker`` available from Zamzow Software, (in the U.S.), that allows you to practice, as well as automatically run through a great number of hands using a given payout table and strategy.Cheers, `	0

`== One Addition ==Mustafaa, I promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately.One thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion.Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:* ``On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.``should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:* Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)* There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...* The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. * Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.I'll post links and add more explanations if needed.  08:56, 2004 Dec 2 (UTC)`	0

`== Info and links ==* The Cause for Invasion:``The goal was to remake the political landscape—to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organization and install a right-wing Christian Lebanese leader prepared to sign a peace deal with Israel. But Operation Peace for Galilee ended in failure.`` :``Israel launched operation ``Peace for Galilee`` and invaded Lebanon in 1982 in what was sold to the Israeli public as a bid to drive the Palestine Liberation Organization back from the northern border. Sharon went on to drive the PLO out of Lebanon and to try to install a more friendly regime there. ... The Israelis stayed, and their effort to install a new regime ended in disaster.`` * The Invasion was planned:``When, in early June 1982, terrorists of the Abu Nidal organization, a PLO splinter group, badly wounded the Israeli ambassador in London during an assassination attempt, Israel seized the pretext for launching its long-planned offensive.`` * The Invasion was opposed by the US and the UN::* See ``U.N. Security Council Resolution 509``:*``On June 6, President Reagan, in France to meet with the G-7 Heads of Government at the Versailles Economic Summit, dispatched Habib to Israel to try to restore the cease-fire. That same day the United States joined a unanimous U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and that the border cease-fire be observed by all parties.`` * Other details::``September 15, 1982: Ariel Sharon arrives in Beirut to personally direct the IDF campaign ... The IDF launches sporadic shellfire at Sabra and Shatila.`` :``September 15, 1982: An Israeli divisional intelligence officer, providing an update briefing on the situation in the camps, reports to the Chief of Staff: ``It seems there are no terrorists there, in the camp; Sabra camp is empty.`` (Kahan Commission Final Report, p. 24).:``Two Israeli paratroopers tell correspondent Michael Gerti: On Thursday evening, as darkness fell, Palestinian women from Shatila arrived at the post and hysterically told us that the Phalangists were shooting their children and putting the men in trucks. I reported this to my commander, but all he said was: 'It is okay, do not worry.' My order was to tell the women to go back home. However, many women, and entire families as well, ran away from the camps to the north. I went back and repeated my report over and over. Each time, however, the answer was the same: ``It is okay.``...It was possible to stop the massacre in Shatila, even on Thursday; had they acted on what we reported to our commander.

Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors.  Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.TAB_TOKENNOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally.  We are asked back year after year.  Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision.  We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue.  Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.TAB_TOKENNOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members.  The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side.    Attendees who were interested would have  appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.TAB_TOKENThe vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents.  Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC.  This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk.  Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her son’s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.TAB_TOKENLa Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.  In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations.  The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care,  including the requirement that service providers must “discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.” (on-line at ).TAB_TOKENThe breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum.  In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, “The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,” available at .  Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the mother’s breast after circumcision.  The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition.  The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.TAB_TOKENLa Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization.  However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization.  A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint.  For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.TAB_TOKENThe Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim  moms.  Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk.TAB_TOKENThe Board’s action is hypocritical in light of LLL’s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents.  LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL.TAB_TOKENLLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding.  New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons.  NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens.T	0

`== WikiProject Wiki Syntax ==Good morning.  Thank you for helping to clean up the Wikisyntax.  I was not aware of that effort until I saw some of your edits.  I do, however, have to disagree with some of the minor changes you've been making in a couple of paragraphs where the author/editor has chosen to itemize his/her arguments.  For example, at Bee learning and communication, someone wrote ``The primary lines of evidence used by the odor plume advocates are 1) clinical experiments with odorless sugar sources which show that worker bees are unable to recruit to those sources and 2) logical difficulties of a small-scale dance...``   You changed those to ``(1)...`` and ``(2)...``. This may be a small point, but I believe it is stylistically incorrect. Surrounding the number on both sides generally indicates a footnote, not a segmented argument.I'm guessing that this is going to create some false positives on the automated list of possible syntax errors but I'm going to revert those changes.  I've made a comment on the project's Talk page about the problem as I see it.  Thanks.    `	1

`::::::::You incorrectly infer from the agreement to include other pictures that all editors have agreed to delete the photo you propose to delete. There was no consensus to delete the photo. There was your demand that that the photo was unrepresentative and there were other editors acting to find photos to assuage your demands by providing other photos that would meet your demands. That doesn't imply agreement with your demand to delete a factual photo. It is not an explicit expression of consensus. At least on other editor involved in the discussion at that time - Tareq - is disputing your assertion of consensus and I am disputing your claims that the photo is ``unrepresentative``, the basis for deleting it, and the existence of your alleged consensus now. The picture of the Wall that you want to delete is very significant. It shows the ugliness of the Israeli wall. There is no rule that says photos must be representative. A photo is a factual representation of the facts. This is aone part of the wall. Deleting it is a form of cesorship of the reality of the Wall in at least some places. In any case, how is representativeness determined? Your opinion does not suffice. What percentage of the wall is fence and what percent is wall? What is the representative appearance in populated areas? What is considered a representative portion? What are the future final plans for the wall's appearance? The photo will be returned top the article without deleting any other photo. Adding information is preferable to deleting information.    `	1
`::::::There is nothing inherently POV about discussing Israeli violence against Palestinian children. It is a fact. It is a recognized problem as the data in the article reflects.  We don't balance articles about Nazi concentration camps by renaming it ``Violence in the Nazi-Jewish conflict`` and then inserting sections about Jewish uprisings against the Nazis in order to deflect attention from Nazi atrocities and paint the deaths of oppressed Jews and oppressing Nazis as if they are equivalent.   That is what the WikiZionists intend to do. They want to rename this article to something ``neutral`` (i.e. something that doesn't reflect the facts about Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children) and then pad it with sensationalized Zionist POV sections about Palestinian resistance to Zionist aggression. They already have plenty of Zionist POV articles smearing all palestinians as fanatic terrorists rather than victims of Zionist terrorism.

`§ I got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of Africa.  I had a closer look at the maps I found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. The one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of Australia into two regions. I'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. If you check out the Cavelli-Sforza map (which I now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones  Cavelli-Sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable.  Sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. But for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the Americas. § In a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. If I hadn't really looked carefully at it I'm pretty sure I'd have missed the white band. The uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the WWW that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it.  ==Cleanup==We need to clean up the article. The sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. For example, there shouldn't be a paragraph ``:``In everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...``at the end of ``History of the term``. Nor should the ``Anthropology and genetics`` section, being placed after the history section, i.e. we are through with the historical aspect now, begin with :``In the 19th century many natural scientists made three claims about race: ...``(i.e. this bit still belongs in the 'history' section). Also the case studies (USA, Brazil) should either be exported to special articles, or at least be placed after the more general phylogenetic subsection. Somebody should read the entire article and weed out repetitions, too.  == Von Luschan scale ==§ The von Luschan scale was a manufactured set of standard tiles that were colored so that a researcher could in relatively rapid order sort through his/her tiles and find the one that came closest to matching a given subject's skin color. Essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. They have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. Each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. Although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. Similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von Luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `	1
`::There is no difference in rhetoric. The quote that Jayjg took out of context was a citation from the Qur'an that Hamas uses (also out of context) to justify the killing of Jews. Zionists use similar tactics (that's where Hamas learned it) by quoting the Torah and Talmud to justify the killing of non-Jews. ``We must treat the Arabs like the Amalekites`` is a common sentiment among extremist Zionists. There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it. Zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children, imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-Jews in the name of their Jewish supremacist ideology and state.  `	1

` ==death to critics==So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  : ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!  You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries`` <- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  :Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev	1
`== OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page ==Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename::What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  ::As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).::Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.

He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners.

`:: First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).    ::*``Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.``  ::*``On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``   ::The Mitchell Report:::*``Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``  ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right. ::``* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded.::* August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day.::* September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. ``::Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  `	1
`::::You are copying one-sided (Israeli) material from Palestine Facts and Jewish Virtual Library  ``Soon after he left, outbreaks of stone throwing occured on the Temple Mount and in the vicinity, leaving 28 Israeli policemen injured, three of whom were hospitalized; no Palestinians were injured in these incidents.`` Other sources paint a completely different picture: ``On September 29, the Israeli army increased its presence in Jerusalem and began intimidating the Palestinians. When the Muslims attempt to enter al-Aqsa for prayers they were barred and later Israeli forces opened fire at the civilian demonstrators, including children, killing 6 and wounding 220. In the first few days of the Intifada, the IDF fired about 700,000 bullets in the West Bank, and 300,000 in Gaza. In the first six days of the Intifada, 61 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and 2,657 were injured, many of them children. At the same time four Israelis were killed, with 35 wounded.`` . Why are the names of Israeli soldiers like David Biri and Yossi Tabaji more important than the names of the numerous Arab civilian victims? This is a subtle form of racism where one side is humanized with names and the other is dehumanized as a faceless number of casualties.   `	1

`I don't believe that ``The Family International`` formerly known as ``The Family``, ``Family of Love``, Children of God and many front names internationally, should be called a ``cult`` and here is why. I love ``cult`` classic movies and sometimes when one refers to a ``cult`` following it is nothing more than a fan club. Now if it were called a ``Highly Destructive Cult`` or something more specific I could heartily agree having been exploited in the group in my youth and seen it leading towards gross abuse and negligence of second generation children. I don't think movie stars or famous people would throw their support behind a group that clearly has advocated pedophilia right from the top (David Brandt Berg) or things like the ``LJR`` instituted under Zerby and co. Neither do I put any stock in hired guns or ``experts`` that defend ``The Family`` or whatever they may be calling themselves at any given time because in any profession there are people that would defend Jeffrey Dahmer or NAMBLA followers if paid enough or given enough favors or noteriety.

Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.``*A week after she was killed:``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes.

`It's worth noting somewhere that the term ``sustainable`` or ``sustainability`` is heavily deprecated among Greens and especially Gaians for implying some kind of steady-state output.In other words, ecological yields vary, and can be maximized but will still vary considerably with weather patterns, insect migration paths, and etc... they can't be made as uniform as outputs of a factory - which almost seems to be the goal of ``sustainability``.Also, to say something is ``sustainable`` or ``not`` implies that there is some actual test for it.  Which there isn't.  It's all a matter of scenarios and guesses.The ``Limits to Growth`` type of numerical modelling, largely discredited now, was the actual origin of the ``sustainable`` paradigm.Today ecologists are far more concerned with homeostasis, keystone species, and homeorhetic process, none of which benefit much from external measures of ``sustainability``.Complex problem.

`What I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation.  Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.Oh, incidentally, it would be a great help if you, and all contributors, made use of the ``edit summary`` section so that the rest of us can more efficiently keep track of who added/deleted what and for what reason.

====Chinese yo-yo → Diabolo====Entry for Diabolo was removed and the topic nowadays just redirects to Chinese yo-yo. Chinese yo-yo is not the correct name for the item depicted in the entry. The juggling prop is called Diabolo universally in juggling circles. The original move was probably initiated by an ill-informed newbie to the art. The content of the page has deteroriated as people have been removing stuff which does not relate to Chinese yo-yo (which also looks different). Also the external links and the picture are irrelevant to 'Chinese yo-yo' as they clearly refer to Diabolo. Diabolo and Chinese yo-yo are quite two different things. I propose leaving a new empty entry for Chinese yo-yo which could be used to tell about the particular item. Addition: To see what I mean. Here's a Chinese Yo-Yo and here's a Diabolo. I ask for this change now because I thought someone more proficient with Wikipedia would come to resque and correct the error.    * Support - Initiated by me. I wrote much of the original Diabolo entry.   * Support - I've never heard the item depicted and described in that article refered to as anything but diabolo. —  * Support - I used to juggle diabolos, and I never called it a Chinese yo-yo.  * Support - I don't think it is fair to characterise the original move as ill-informed. But if different editors are pulling in different directions, it sounds like you may have a case for demerging the article. Diabolo can then concentrate on the juggling and Chinese yo-yo can concentrate on its origins, history, and use in Chinese dance etc. In which case a straight move wouldn't be required.   	0

`Totalitarian and dictatorship are two words with meaning and indeed are defined at length on Wikipedia with their own articles. Perhaps we should delete the articles, because no regime could ever qualify. That is not what neutrality means. The USSR qualifies under those definitions, under the vast majority of non-Marxist scholarship (we have already dealt with the sources issue at length), as reflected in Britannica and Encarta which both deal with the former USSR at length and very adequately synthesize that scholarship into long articles. Also, earlier versions of this article included the terms and were edited out. I encourage those interested to go back and see what went on previously. The issue is whether ``totalitarian dictatorships`` are non-neutral language. I don't think they are non-neutral at all.  The words have meaning, I think Fred has written at length on how the USSR qualified and I defer to his effort. Perhaps someone should post it up here. Now is the time to resolve it. `	1

I don't like the last paragraph. Holding that you have some particular negative right doesn't mean that you believe that you have a right to make others protect you from having that right violated. That would mean you had double standard, in that you say you have negative rights, but someone else doesn't and therefore it's ok for you to coerce him to protect your negative rights. This would be an akward position to hold, and i doubt many people do hold it. So, I'm thinking about deleting the paragraph. (RJII) Dec 23 2004	1

`:: According to ``The Uralic Languages`` (edited by Daniel Abandolo), palatalization is a feature of every language discussed in the book. They include Erzya, Meadow Mari, Hill Mari, Komi, Udmurt, Khanty, Mansi, Hungarian, Nenets, Selkup, Nganasan, Kamassian, Livonian, Estonian, Finnish (eastern dialects), Votic, Veps, and Northern Sami. There was no information on some minor languages in the book, but it can be easily seen that palatalization is common in every branch of the Uralic language family.  `	1
`== Synagogue ==Hi there! One or two comments and, please, do not be offended: Synagogue comes from the greek words συν 'syn' = con (as in 'con-servative' for example) and αγωγή 'agogi' = discipline/manner/education, which itself comes from the verb άγειν 'agein' = lead (also look here: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=synagogue)The word 'agogi' from the ancient times (and even today!) has an absolutely positive meaning: for example, in modern Greece, people say ``He has agogi`` meaning ``He has manners``, ``He knows how to behave`` etc.Therefore, I would ask you to accept my previous correction, which for some reason you thought it was offending or negative. It is NOT. That's how it is in Greek, and that's the truth... Kokoriko: 13:09 pm GMT, 9/1/05`	0

-The first paragraph of the 'notable characteristics' section states that aluminium is both soft and strong. This seems unlikely to be the case. In the case of pure aluminium the yield strength is in the region of 10 MPa which certainly isn't strong as far as construction materials are concerned (Al alloys may have yield strengths in the region of 200-500 MPa). As a result I have removed the word strong (alloying is mentioned later anyway).Surely aluminium is not resistent to magnetism but is simply non-magnetic? I have altered the 'applications' section to reflect this (and hopefully I'm right).The term 'weak' is ambiguous (strength, stiffness, hardness, toughness, fatigue resistance?). I replaced it with a link to tensile strength as this is probably the most familar mechanical property.	0

== Vic arious Liability ==An employer is vicariously liable for negligent acts or omissions by his employee in the course of employment whether or not such act or omission was specifically authorised by the employer. To avoid vicarious liability, an employer must demonstrate either that the employee was not negligent in that the employee was reasonably careful or that the employee was acting in his own right rather than on the employer's business.It can also be understood this way: When one person is liable for the negligent actions of another person, even though the first person was not directly responsible for the injury. For instance, a parent can be vicariously liable for the harmful acts of a child and an employer can be vicariously liable for the acts of a worker.This I find very interesting, thinking of whether a demarcation exist. When can one say that the Employer is exonerated from the employee's acts, especially if the employee used the resources provided by the Employer (Tools, Vehicles, Landed Property etc)?I require additional research to give more details.If however anybody has anything to add, please assist.	0

OK. I notice last night about 5 am or so Wyss said to me 'goodnight Ennis' which is just yet another personal attack - unpunished (of course). Anyway I followed your advice and have taken the 'challenge' to I am not asking you to comment - I know you have to/want to/feel the need to 'keep in' with other Wikis and I am just an anonymous Brit (or worse - Sollog Arrrgh!) I am just bringing the challenge to your attention as I suspect Wyss will avoid it and the post will be reverted - and his £2000 (or equivalent) will not go to help the bereaved. Remember - no comment required.   	1
I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.This was dismissed.Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.That too was dismissed.So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.Two choices.Stop posting completelyTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.Hence the challenge.I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   	1
==To Gamaliel==I see Wyss has now deleted all my recent posts on his page - without (he claims) even reading them. One of the posts was asking him to explain where the Sollog prophecies were wrong (I linked to them). This he deleted without reading it.It's pointless - I give up.Please could you tell me where I complain to and also perhaps you'd do it if you can do it easily, please delete every single post I have ever made on the Talk Sollog pages as it's pointless trying to do anything there. I'd be better off elsewhere.Wiki is not 'out of control' - it's 'too much in control' and the accusations of Wiki Cult certainly have some bearing. 	0

`-Continued:I checked the history of recent edits.I find it hypocritical that the words ``sell`` and ``price`` have been changed to ``offer`` and ``donation``. What the * is that all about?Is it because THC Ministry has been registered as a religion that the action of trading funds for a product has ``miraculously`` transformed from simple business to ``donations`` and ``offerings``? That is marketing speech. That is in no way different from any businessman's simple strategy.Since THC Ministry supposedly ``offers`` a product in exchange of a ``donation``, shouldn't that imply that they would also give away freely the product in some cases? Shouldn't that imply that there would be no set price, as a donation is usually considered an act of variable value? Because otherwise that is just PLAIN BUSINESS. Nothing saintly about it.I would like to know - just to clear things out - where these ``donations`` go to and who they benefit. Are the funds used to address the issues of unethical drug wars? Are the funds used to fight what is wrong in society? Or are they merely collected to the personal accounts of the ``priesthood`` of THC Ministry? Who could answer me?If one would allow oneself a cynical outlook, he'd certainly see this as a pretty package covering a simple money-making scheme.Juuso`	1
`==Changes, subtle errors ==Oleg, I am concerned about the edits that you are making.  My first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be.  It used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. The result is the sublte introduction of errors...   in part by removing that precision.  For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.  And you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...The ring is never commutative when the field is not F_p ... The field is called F_p not Z/pZ dammit. We already talked about this before. Nobody but you calls it that.Stating that aP(x) is also additive is important, I don't see why you cut that out. k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x).  These g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}Using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.Look, I don't see why you need to be monkeying with this article, why don't you write an article on Ore's invariants of the additive polynomials, or the moore determinant instead, hell, there is no entry for the vandermonde determinant even ...  or start the article on a carlitz module or drinfeld module instead, or fix the article on non-archimedean analysis which really needs a lot of work, cause its missing all that jazz ...  `	1

Removed textHumanitism is the form of messianism held by the Sabis and their Notzarim. The clergy (Sabiyah) identifies and promotes a forever imminent just ideal in the midsts of the (Notzrim) congregation. The congregation are to attach themselves to the identified just mission and become its body and limbs through social solidarity to make the ideal manifest and thus bring about progress where the best efficiency takes pride of position. Efficient progress is not illegal as long as it is not against the Humanitist directives and there is always a way for the clergy to observe Torah protocols.

`*********************************Josif Stalin IS one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, the other two being Hitler and Mao. Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled ``Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.If you fail to mention the very criminality of Stalin and Mao in the very header of their wiki articles, then you are looking for an edit war, period. We, the people of ex-soviet bloc countries are personally insulted when anglo-saxons pet ``Uncle Joe`` as the kind old leader. Be glad he did not rule you (you may not have been born then with 10% probability because your father would get executed or die in the Gulags beforehand, no kidding). Acknowledge our sufferings by stating the truth: Stalin was one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, period.Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary (etomcat@freemail.hu)`	1
`You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.Regards: Tamas Feher.`	1

== Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==I edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.The Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.Which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.If you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.From what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else. 	0

I realize that several people (apparently including Rama) have attempted to point to Israel's bombing of Osiraq as the catalyst for Iraq's nuclear program, but it just does not hold up to scrutiny. Iraqi defectors as well as the IAEA's post Gulf War investigations found that Iraq had a clandestine program dating back to the late 1970's. Most of Iraq's nuclear work was done at Al Tuwaitha. Although the IAEA had access to Al Tuwaitha, it was extremely limited with the majority of the complex off limits to IAEA inspectors because no “declared nuclear activity” was taking place there. Evidently Blix saw nothing wrong with this.For the section quoting (although I did not include the quote to avoid POV) Blix praising Iraq compliance on the eve of the Invasion of Kuwait and during the beginning of Iraq's crash bomb program: NuclearFuel, August 20, 1990	0

It's a very simple citation. International law is clear on this matter in the extreme. The UN Charter states, ``The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.`` The Act openly admits the intention of overthrowing Saddam, ``It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power.`` There is, very simply, no room for interpretation.  `	1

 Jan 2005 (UTC)::Generally, I don't acknowledge the comments of someone who goes out of his/her way to talk down to me.  Suffice it to say that the burden of proof is on you and the Democrats to prove that the Grand Kleagle is NOT a racist pig of a Senator.  He was the one who choose to join the Klan, it was he that choose to recruit new members to the cross-burning organization.  It was NOT me that made him do those things.  It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.  Why do you feel the need to defend the Kleagle?  Oh, by the way, I can't believe that I even responded to you.  I only responded because you are fellow Jayhawk, but I normally would not respond to comments of your tone.  I will continue to remove and edit any untrue information that you place in an article also.  Only 13 Senators voted against Rice.  That is 13% of the Senators.  That is not a large segment of the societyno matter how hard you try to make people believe that it is.  The one African-American Senator did not vote against her.  Only the most partisan Democrats voted against her.- 01:19, 31	1
`== US emissions description is totally contentless now. ==The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.Regards:Tamas Feher from Hungary``etomcat@freemail.hu```	1

`: For the benefit of the many, let's elaborate on ``A clear misuse of Juran's assumption (...)``:: In manufacturing, systems are designed so that everybody contributes a pre-defined amount of work, especially in synchronous settings such as assembly lines. Nobody could argue for a Pareto distribution there.: In agriculture and mining, individual contributions are sometimes measurable (e.g. basketful of apples picked per person per shift). A for-profit organization seeks out ``good`` workers, so the bottom part of the distribution will not be represented at all. Family and community operations often find a way to gainfully employ persons with less strength (e.g. 11-year-old girls) or with disabilities (e.g. blind people), but their number is not large enough to warrant a Pareto distribution.: Which brings us to the only economic system many readers have experience of: The services sector. In it, there is a place for ``stars`` in fields like moviemaking and advertising, where moneymaking ability is so narrowly distributed that it can sustain not just an 80:20 modeling, but 90:10 and even 99:1 (think of the distribution of pay in the fashion modeling world).: In other service areas, such as software development, it has been argued (and many influential minds such as Frederick Brooks and Joel Spolsky have devised methods for measuring and quantifying this) that a top designer, programmer, or QA person is roughly ten times as effective  as an average one.:It can be agued that this observation distribution does not carry to other areas of computing such as system administration.: Finally, the difference between top waiters (or shoe salespeople) and average ones may not warrant any Pareto analysis.:  `	1

`:My edits do conform to a neutral point of view, I am correcting entries that are not NPOV. For example saying ``there was opposition from many`` is a weasel remark as there was also 'support from many'. The article on Government positions on Iraq is NPOV but the reference to it is not, the reference to it should be either deleted, moved down to the section that specifically deals with support and opposition, or be changed as I have done on a number of occasions to indicate that there was support AS WELL AS opposition to the invasion.`	0

`== Some things to note about Stalin ==1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a ``dictator`` per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:``http://www.sulinet.hu/eletestudomany/archiv/2000/0042/forr/1319-2..jpg``Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary``etomcat@freemail.hu```	0

I would also remind you that these two articles are full of plagiarized material and past instances have shown me that this user is extremely uncooperative in removing such material.

I would also point out, again, for like the umpteenth fucking time, that this user has been using plagiarized material repeatedly and only takes it out after being beaten over the head with it. Secondly, don’t you fucking dare try and threaten me with what might and might not be said in arbitration.

It doesn't matter if Byrd was a Kleagle 60 years ago or 50 years ago or if was a Kleagle in 2001 when he was talking about ``White N****.``  The fact that he was a Kleagle is the probably one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits that himself when he tells other potential Kleagles not to become Kleagles because the whole Kleagle thingeven if you are like Byrd and think the Kleagle thing is coolwill hurt you because guys like me (the supposedly UNserious conservative) will remind him of his Kleagle days every chance that I get.  Byrd was a Kleagle and that is one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits the fact that his Kleagle-ness has held him back to bigger and better things.  And don't argue that he didn't want bigger and better things than to be the head Kleagle from West Virginia.  He did run for the Presidency and the whole Kleagle surely couldn't have helped.  You like the guy, so you want to minimize the Kleagle thing, but it would NOT be NPOV because that's who Byrd is:  the oldest, highest ranking Kleagle still in politics.  Head Kleagle.

`==Electrical properties/Ultrapure==I fully appreciate the edits to correct my atroicous ) spelling and formatting to a recent edit I made but I do think one part should remain the same. The sectin in question was changed to:``It is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 182 kilohm-meters at 25 degrees Celsius. This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis, ultrafiltered and deionized ultrapure water systems used for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding that of even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in ultrapure water will begin to noticably raise its conductivity level by up to several hundred kilosiemens per meter.``Now, I know wikipedia must conform to standards, a policy which I am an ardent advocate of, and the meter is the SI unit of length as is the kilohm. However, ultrapure water is never, ever referred to using these units. It is always referred to as being 18.2 megohm-cm and has in fact been so often used with these terms that it has bcome synonymous with them and is often simply called ``megohm water`` in the literature.

`Dear Wikipedia ````Neutrality```` guardian, Re Saddam Hussein entry,no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not? You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything. Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen!Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance? I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there mustbe some divine logic here beyond my rationality.Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then?Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLYthat means not ONLY the palestinians! Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds?if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as``Human rights situation``? and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all thehenceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps?remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men.they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise. And this pargraph:an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destructiondo you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!And this,``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``Are you hinting that this sentence:``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are therany references of this, or just hearsay?Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it!(never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!`	1

-As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen. Note that the five inner planets (excluding Earth) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life.	0

`Certain none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges. The term ``mukim`` was certain the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore.On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus. In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio. It is highly likely than the name was chosen by Town builders following that original name on the Map.`	1

Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?	1

`== Ward Churchill is Not An Indian ==I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `	1
:I am sorry that your edits were removed from the article. I did not remove them, although I did think about how to edit that material. I will look further at what you wrote on my talk page when I get a chance. I am in agreement with your distaste at Ward Churchill putting himself forth as a spokesman for the Native community but even more at those who have accepted him as a spokesman, like the people at the University of Colorado who put him on a fast tenure track, bypassing others, most of whom were not even interviewed. However, judging from his appearance I do think he probably has some Native American ancestory and feel we should take his word for it. The real issues have to do with his actions and ideas.  ::Thank you for the response.  I don't disagree with his right to speak.  I don't agree with a lot he has to say, but that is irrelavant. He does have a First Amendment right to state it.  I just believe that he should be held out as an Indian, when he isn't.  That's all. And I don't believe that we should take his word for itconcerning his alleged Indian heritage.  I know that you have your opinion concerning that and that's fine.  I'm not trying to convince you but it IS an issue for most people in Indian Country.  I forward to your respons. 	1

`From the Village pump:===Quote marks in article title?===I have created an article for ``Live free or die`` - the delightfully quirky state motto of New Hampshire. The question is: Should the title have quotation marks in it?I didn't put them in because it seemed weird, but since the title refers to the words as words rather than their meaning, maybe they should be there.I can't find other article titles that are phrases to act as guidelines, although that's probably just due to lack of imagination on my part. Any thoughts?-  15:04 27 May 2003 (UTC): It won't be an issue like that. You can't have double quotes in article titles. You can have single quotes in a title, but I wouldn't recommend it for this case, just the bare words. Furthermore, I would suggest having the actual article at State motto of New Hampshire, New Hampshire (motto), State motto (New Hampshire), or something like that, and Live free or die as a redirect to that.   15:10 27 May 2003 (UTC):: P.S. Hmm, judging by the single blue link I now see above, it looks as though someone else has pre-emptively disagreed with me, though. ;)   15:12 27 May 2003 (UTC):::There is, it turns out, already a List of state mottos page. I linked to Live Free or die from there. I'm not enthusiastic about titling the article some variant of New Hampshire (motto), since nobody cares about state mottos as such - in this case people are vastly more likely to have heard the phrase and want to find out about it, and IMHO the article title should reflect that approach. But I'm not wedded to the idea, since a search on the phrase would find the article either way   15:25 27 May 2003 (UTC): See Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (slogans), where some discussion/voting on the subject is under way.

They would also honor Kepler and Ptolemy who first described the constellation over 1700 years earlier.It comes as no surprise that they acted as they did. 01:18, 2005 Feb 24 (UTC)`	1

But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a ``cheap shot.``  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.

`::You have a serious problem here - how can anyone possibily define one single ``Jewish position``? . Regarding your claim that Hebron is a ``Jewish city`` - as you well know the Jewish community in Hebron has been a minority for hundereds of years. Calling it a Palestinian city makes no judgement on who should live there and who shouldn't because the term ``Palestinian`` is a nationalist term with no direct religious implications. I happen to agree with you that ``The State of Israel does not have the authority to decide what is a Jewish city and what isn't``. The question remains: considering that Palestinian Arabs make up the vast majority of the population of Hebron and that the government of Israel designates it a Palestinian city, what justification is there for calling it a ``Jewish city`` other than an explictly racist one?  `	1
`== Mascot ==The other day, I listed ``Keggy the Keg`` as our (Dartmouth's) mascot and provided a link for him. Somebody named dpdsmith took it down and claimed that it was a ``one time only joke mascot created by a campus humor magazine.`` While Keggy the Keg was created by Dartmouth's humor magazine, he is in fact the mascot of Dartmouth College.  Keggy was conceive partially out of the student body’s growing disgust by the ever increasing ineptitude of the current college administration and it’s over zealous attempts to ban and censor anything and everything that could possibly offend anyone. Keggy is by no means a “one time only joke.” He made his debut at the homecoming football game of ’03 and since has attended almost every football game and most hockey games.  Students all over campus can be seen sporting the attractive Keggy T-shirts which depict the lovable fellow drinking from his own tap and have the words “Get Pumped,” and “Go Kegs” written on them.  Further evidence of Keggy’s legitimacy can be seen by that fact that snow sculpture for the most recent Dartmouth Winter Carnival (’05) was an enormous pirate ship which was christened “Captain Keggy’s Carnival Cruiser” by the student assembly.While Keggy may not be recognized as the official mascot by perversely politically correct and out-of-touch-with-reality administrators, Keggy instantly reached iconic status at his first homecoming game, and has since found a permanent place in the hearts of the sons and daughters of Dartmouth.`	0

== Some personal observations here: ==Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   	0
== Errant image tagger? ==Hi.  I helped a lot on the first round of the image tagging project.  Unfortunately I've been toooo busy to help lately.  But there's possibly an issue with one of the taggers currently working on the project I wanted to bring to your attention, since you're so involved with it.The description page for an image I posted some time ago showed up in my watchlist today, so I checked it out.  Turns out that a previous vandal had removed my {{GFDL}} tag along with the source info.  That change went unnoticed by me, so it landed in the latest list of untagged images.  Today's change was  putting a {{PD}} tag on it.  Of course, as creator of the image I know for a fact that it is not public domain, and don't see how  could have labeled it as such – {{unverified}}, perhaps, but not {{pd}}. is listed on the untagged images project page.  I looked at this user's contributions, and [s]he is busy tagging away.  But it looks to me like that user is being way too free with {{pd}}. I know for a fact that [s]he tagged my image {{pd}} without cause (didn't even query my user talk page), and others look suspicious, too.  I also see [s]he has tagged images {{unknown}} that should have {{gfdl}} (:Image:Laferteairshow001.jpg),  {{unverified}} that should have {{coatofarms}} (:Image:Villegaignon-crest.gif), and other problems.I left a note on the user's talk page about my map image in particular.  I don't know if you or someone else would want to review this user's tagging contributions and try to educate the user on how to do a better job.  I'd attempt this myself, but, as I said, I'm too busy to contemplate getting into a back-and-forth with someone or going through and retagging all the images [s]he has touched.Thanks for all your great work on this important project and the related image projects!    	0

`== Pathetic Motorways, and the ``Walton Summit Motorway`` ==I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a ``Wacky Website``, but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.If it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the ``start of restrictions`` sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states ``A57(M)``, but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the ``Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995`` that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a ``C``, ``D`` or ``U`` classification, which do not appear on road signs.

Aha, similar issues surfaced some time ago at Talk:Grammatical tense and it was decided to go for a rewrite from scratch. At Grammatical tense/multilingual sources we have started to collect data and to draft a better article; the thought-out opinions of both of you would be much appreciated! You two might also be interested in the Linguistics section of Wikiproject Countering Systemic Bias. Issues like this, like Noetica remarks, often have to do with the use of traditional (Latin-inspired) terminology. The Linguistics section of the CSB project aims at a more universal and modern approach in Wikipedia's linguistic articles. —   	0

Ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, I am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in CO2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels).  Now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing CO2.  Right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at Mauna Lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the CO2 humans dump into the atmosphere.  Basically because CO2 has increased, these systems draw down more CO2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution.  Some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as CO2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed.  Obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max CO2.:::Taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad.  How bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost.  Not exactly a risk I am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties.  However, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table.  For example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of Antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial CO2 levels.  (This was presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, but I am having trouble finding a reference).:::I think your consideration of how high can CO2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting.  However, given the uncertainties involved in such estimates, I would really like to see if we can find something published on the issue.  An academic paper would (hopefully) have spent more time thinking through these issues and work out what kind of a range of values is possible.::: 	0

`Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy::Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   `	1

`If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the ``forced`` out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they ``lived happily ever after!``, and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and ``Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge``!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their ``educated`` people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   `	1
`== A Request from El_C and Myself ==Hey Sam,Firstly (and I've repeated this to El_C), if you want to discuss things or have an argument or the like, that's fine, but I'd prefer you not do so on my talk page. Please keep anything there only to relevant communications.Secondly, El_C has some requests, namely that you try to watch yourself and tone down language that he feels is unduly insulting and offensive. Comments like ``This is BS`` or what have you seem to be what is at issue. While both I and he acknowledge that tempers can run hot in user disputes — I've certainly had my share — such behavior is not conducive to any sort of settlement, and El_C would like that addressed as we proceed through dispute resolution. Perhaps give the Wikipedia:Civility and Wikipedia:Wikiquette articles a once over, although I don't doubt you're well versed in their contents. He and I both just want to keep the amount of personal comments, value judgments, subjective assessments, etc. down to a minimum.Thirdly, I'm posting a request for mediation right after this is complete. You indicated before that you were amenable to such mediation, and I operate under the assumption that this is not changed. Let me know if it is, as that is for obvious reasons quite important. Otherwise, check the mediation page for appropriate comments.  `	1

Anyway, the sentence as it is makes readers think that knowledge of statistics is all you need to judge the question, when in reality you need knowledge of statistics and evolutionary biology.

I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible.

`==Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.==Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.  The Club of Rome banner is one that Javier Solana flies the most proudly!`	1

:That all the people interested had to go from here to your talk page? How clumsy, this is the natural place for the response. The theory that the vaccines cause Autism isn't accepted by the scientific community. Some weaknesses of the theory (from Quackwatch.org):# The known number of ASD cases has been increasing since 1979, but there was no jump after the introduction of MMR vaccine in 1988.# Cases vaccinated before 18 months of age had similar ages at diagnosis as did cases who had been vaccinated after 18 months or not vaccinated, indicating that vaccination does not result in earlier expression of autistic characteristics.# At age two years, the MMR vaccination coverage among the ASD cases was nearly identical to coverage in children in the same birth cohorts in the whole region, providing evidence of an overall lack of association with vaccination.# The first diagnosis of autism or initial signs of behavioral regression were not more likely to occur within time periods following vaccination than during other time periods.# A weak statistical association existed between MMR vaccination and initial parental concern, but this appears to have been due to parents' difficulty in recalling precise age at onset and a preference for approximating the age as 18 months.:What seminar did you visit?

`First of all, I was unaware of the fact that counties are not treated the same way in the East Coast as they are out here. I won't argue the actual figures anymore because your's are obviously correct, and I was mistaken. BUT there is a distinct difference between ``feeling`` like you are part of a city and actually BEING part of that city. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley and now live in the Los Angeles County half of Agoura Hills, I am, by most any definition, an ``Angelino``. But I'm taking classes right now at Moorpark Junior College, which takes it's main pull of students from Simi Valley/Moorpark/Camarillo. Many of those people seem quite content with the fact that they AREN'T part of Los Angeles and are quite happy to remind people as much. They consider it to be a better ``cleaner`` life where they are and wouldn't want to become part of the city of Los Angeles even if given the chance. Beyond that, they simply aren't residents of Los Angeles or the Greater L.A. area even if they proclaim to be, regardless of what any resident or tourist alike would prefer to believe or tell people. By that logic, San Diego residents may as well start calling themselves Los Angeles residents, since San Deigo doesn't take much longer to get to from my house (about 3 hours) than does LAX (which can take 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to reach in rush hour traffic).`	1
` 2005 (UTC)AgreeI think that Wikipedia is doing things differently, and showing that knowledge and science isn't only made up of white males would be another ``different`` and positive thing.

`The following lists the chain of events which led to the inclusion of entities which are not countries to the list. I suppose it takes some detective work to come up with this, although it isnt really that difficult. I leave it up to you guys to interpret the intentions behind this sequence of events:===The old version===As seen in the version timestamped 07:25, 7 Jan 2005 in this page's edit history, the page listed only countries (as commonly accepted to refer to fully independent entities as recognised by the UN), with an opening line which reads:``This is a list of countries that only have a land border with one other country.``===Carbon copy created===On 01:21, 4 Feb 2005, a similarly titled page called List of countries bordering only one country was created by a user named . In the first version of that page, the opening line reads:``This is a list of countries and dependent territories having land border with only one country.Notes:This list includes dependent territories and some disputed or occupied areas that are de facto independent.``Interestingly, that first version includes Hong Kong and Macau as the only two non-independent entities, while Singapore was listed under a classification called ``Arguable``.===Merger?===Within a few hours, the page has evolved to this version at 03:13, 4 Feb 2005. Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``In addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.Back in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005===Merged===By 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request. This effectively places 's introductory paragraph concerning non-independent entities, as well as his entries for these, into that list as can be seen in edit version 19:01, 7 Feb 2005, without  probably suspecting anything unusual.===Contestations===Since this merger, debates over the inclusion of entities which are not countries ensued, unsurprisingly, as we can see above and in the history of edits. It is interesting that  made no mention about the merger process which sparked this discourse. In addition, as we can all see from the above discussions,  was quoted as saying:``They aren't sovereign states, but the same treatment should applies to all lists of countries with the same setting. The notice at the top of the page already tells this list includes not only sovereign states, without any confusions.``It has to be noted, that again he did not mention who was the one who wrote that paragraph, and nor did he mention how it ends up being introduced to this page.===Deductions and comments?===The chain of events as I noted ends here. Feel free to comment on the above conduct. `	1

`Dear Squeakbox:  I have been very polite to you compared to your incredible persistent rudeness and use of three different identities upon me.  I have saved your entire string of correspondence, so have at it!   If I recall correctly, you threatened me with a Honduran jail for ``vandalising Wikipedia`` when I was the one who wrote correctly.  Moreover, I covered Solana's Spanish political career very thoroughly and you falsely accused me of not doing so.  It seems my biggest mistake was once writing ``Ferninand Gonazalez`` instead of ``Felipe Gonzalez`` which would have been a simple edit for you.  Instead, you launched an unseemly internet career of calling me ``a troll`` and a ``vandal`` among other things.  Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty!  If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs, I could make one fine case out of that, but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below.  Why don't you go pick on someone else!  CONSTANCE.`	1

  I have been giving some thought to the radical criticisms portion of the libertarian article since you first asked.  In part, I think many of these criticisms (at least from anarchists) are already present in wikipedia.  Some are in the anarcho-capitalism article, some are spread across a few other articles, and a few are actually represented in the AC criticisms of non-AC libertarianism.  So once I get around to it I might just throw in a link to another article or part thereof that has these criticisms to avoid redundancy.  Other than that I think the brief arguments outlined already are sufficient, though all of it could use a good round of citations and quotes, which is the pain I've been avoiding.

`== Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes ==The main Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on ``Controversies`` which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, ``Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness``. Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell ``biography`` page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:The article accuses me of making public ``plagiarism`` accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the ``reporter`` who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of ``plagiarism`` after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor	1

And he feels free to dismiss statements by recognized leaders in cosmology such as George Ellis, first because he is a ``theist`` (Schroeder only wants theistic opinions if they compromise evolution with the Bible or claim that the Bible teaches absolute geocentrism).  Then Schroeder decrees that Ellis, Hubble and Hoyle are extremists, and insists instead that an unnamed ``scientific community`` on whose behalf he speaks says otherwise. `	0
Once again, Schroeder misrepresents creationist teachings.  Panspermists believe in real evolution, at least from the first cell; baraminologists believe in some changes which some might call micro-evolution but others refuse to call it any sort of evolution. 	1

` 2005 (UTC):::You would think that, since your aim is to tar the Bible/creationists with the geocentric brush.  True NPOV would present both cases adequately.  I won't put up with an ideological opponent telling me how much response is enough.  It is also a statement of fact that all the alleged proofs of geocentrism in the Bible boil down to the same basic thing, words like ``sunset``, which we use today all the time.  And it is common for creationists to discuss the frame of reference when discussing the issue, so this is essential to mention in the interest of fairly representing this viewpoint.  Also, it was an excellent change to use a modern Bible translation, 138  any objections to this?  07:55, 1 Apr`	0

== Architectural ==Changed paragraph mentioning that older georgian buildings on campus include pierson and davenport, etc.  As described in Building a University, 1919-1940, a five-part exhibit celebrating the architecture of Yale University, those buildings were actually built by Rogers along with the other residential colleges.  the georgian/gothic differences are for age and stylistic reasons.  Some structures, such as Branford/saybrook and JE, were existing 1920s gothic buildings modified as residential colleges.  The other colleges with gothic exteriors are all visible from Sterling Library and as such are kept in context.  Rather than have a blandly uniform style across the campus (like most of harvard, had to throw that in there) as was originally planned by the university, Rogers used georgian architecture in areas not visible from Sterling. Thus Georgian Dport and TD are actually newer than many of the gothic buildings on campus. On a side note, the limestone portion of saybrook was originally the Sheffield Scientific School.   	0

`There are many issues involved here, beyond what any individual might wish to see or not see, and the overall effectiveness, popularity, and usefulness of this project is I believe at stake. The issue of the particular image in question has been closed for the time being, Though curiously it was closed immediately after someone posted a note questioning the claim of its supposed ``free-use`` copyright status, which actually, to my knowledge had not been investigated. It is my understanding that the image is now ``safe`` from further debates about its inclusion for at least a month. I can accept this. I do not in any way accept the idea that the case, or the issues that it raises, are closed, and that myself or anyone should simply ``shut up`` about it. On another issue that my activity has raised: I do generally deplore notifying people of things to which they have not expressed any indications of wanting to be involved with in any way, and whether for commercial, political,  or general social goals I would indeed consider that ``SPAMMING``. I  would prefer to consider what I have done ``targeted campaigning`` upon an issue, in which a very strong and very clear consensus that had been indicated in no uncertain terms was CERTAINLY being ignored and evaded. Very contrary to some people's  assessments and accusations against me, I had NO intentions of keeping my actions secret, nor disguising them in any way. I actually expected people's reactions to them to further publicize the issue in question, and that is exactly what occurred. To the minority of those who I contacted who were in any way offended by my attempts to notify them of what was occurring, I can and will apologize, and I ask their pardon. The responses that were generated would indicate that the majority did not feel that way. What I would consider genuine ``spamming``, or at least the most obnoxious extremes of it, is engaged in by people who are well aware that hundreds or thousands of people will be burdened and offended, for every one who might respond positively to their actions, much like the posters of these photographs, which most people DO classify as hardcore pornography, normally limited to ADULTS, including the providers of the images. From the main page of their site I have extracted these quotations (``bolding`` mine): :See our site review in Jane's Sex Guide HornyBoy was rated ``Quality and Original porn``.

`I think there are two related concepts that get called ``autosexual``:# people who feel sexual attraction towards themselves but not towards anyone else/any other type of person. # enjoying oneself sexually as iMeowbot describes) I'm happy to see the more common usage from developmental psychology here, but I don't want to lose the previous sense.

`== Text removed ==In an appearance on ABC News's Nightline on March 15, 2005, Michael Schiavo cited the willingness that Mrs. Schiavo's parents expressed to keep her alive by any means necessary, including quadruple amputation if needed, as a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them. :No, the transcript does not say that.  Schiavo makes it quite clear that it has nothing to do with the Schindlers.   SCHIAVO: If I moved on with my life — and I moved on with a portion of it — but I still have a big commitment to Terri. I made her a promise...And another reason why I won't give Terri back is that Mr. Schindler testified in court, at the 2000 trial, that he would — to keep Terri alive he would cut her arms and legs off and put her on a ventilator just to keep her alive...It's not about the money. This is about Terri. It's not about the Schindlers, it's not about the legislators, it's not about me, it's about what Terri Schiavo wanted. I am in the process of tracking down this testimony, as I recall reading parts of it in another article.   |  ::Ok, here it is, from the December 2003 report to Governor Bush by Dr. Jay Wolfson from the University of South Florida::::Testimony provided by members of the Schindler family included very personal statements about their desire and intention to ensure that Theresa remain alive.  Throughout the course of the litigation, deposition and trial testimony by members of the Schindler family voiced the disturbing belief that they would keep Theresa alive at any and all costs.  Nearly gruesome examples were given, eliciting agreement by family members that in the event Theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs, they would agree to amputate each limb, and would then, were she to be diagnosed with heart disease, perform open heart surgery.  There was additional, difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of Theresa, the parents still derived joy from having her alive, even if Theresa might not be at all aware of her environment given the persistent vegetative state.  'Within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if Theresa had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it. Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that Theresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state.  |  :::: Uhm, how does Mr. Schindler saying that he would cut her arms and legs off not represent that statement? I'm not understanding where your quibble is... the testimony? The statement about amputation? ``a`` key reason vs. ``the`` key reason? Please explain why you removed the text, as I'm not seeing a clear explanation.  :::::The editor wrote that the statement in question was a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them.  The transcript does not say that.  If anything, Schiavo makes it clear that this is one reason directly connected to the Schindler's inability (probably for religious reasons) to respect Terri's wishes.  The quote in Wolfson's report makes that clear, but Schiavo only alludes to the testimony in the transcript.  Also, Michael Schiavo further clarifies in the transcript that this is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted.  The statement that was removed from the article attempted to distort these facts.  Further, the statement by the Schindlers has been put to rest on page 34 of Wolfson's report:Of the Schindlers, there has evolved the unfortunate and inaccurate perception that they will ``keep Theresa alive at any and all costs`` even if that were to result in her limbs being amputated and additional, complex surgical and medical interventions being performed, and even if Theresa had expressly indicated her intention not to be so maintained. During the course of the GAL's [Guardian Ad Litem] investigation, the Schindlers allow that this is not accurate, and that they never intended to imply a gruesome maintenance of Theresa at all costs.   |  :::::: Re-added text, with efforts to manage such issues, feel free to adjust as needed!  ::::::With respect to the statement that Michael Schiavo said in a transcript that ``this`` (ending her life) ``is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted,`` it is important to note that he said exactly the opposite in a sworn deposit	0
My position is that the assumption that C14 levels have been fairly constant is a reasonable starting base for dating items.  However, this assumption is not necessary because of the existance of calibration curves.  Basically, we get almost the same namers from calibration curves that we get from just assuming that C14 levels have been constant for the last 10,000 years.  We have two independent ways of getting at the same data.  The chances of both methods giving us mostly the same data by pure chance is really small.   	0

Unless a confirming cite can be presented, that section should probably be excised. Also, I have yet to come across anybody referring to Gestational Diabetes as Type 4 , or Type 'Anything Else'.

`NOTBELOW IS ANOTHER OF SQUEAKBOX'S LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS:  I have absolutely no control over what others put on their board.  What Mr. Van Nattan writes are his own thoughts.  My book was the standard reference of the 1980s on the New Age Movement.  I disagree with Mr. Van Nattan on many items, including what I consider Catholic bashing.  For anything written by him to be imputed to me is untrue and unfair.  This is as logical as SqueakBox imputing to me every IP address disagreeing with SqueakBox from anywhere in Michigan (i.e. Allen Park, Michigan, where I have probably been maybe 3 to 4 times in my career as a lawyer and no other contact  certainly I have no IP address emanating from Allen Park, Michigan.  The Detroit metropolitan area has at least 3.5 million residents.  Equally ridiciulous is imputation to me of things fro Reston, Virgina, and his biggest stretch was that if it came from Toronto, it had to be Cumbey as that is ``so close to Detroit``.  Clearly his major was not USA geography.  As far as ``original research``  my research on Solana was all culled and distilled from other works.  Synthesizing this is what encyclopedic research is about.  I don't know what SqueakBox is talking about as original research.  Does he mean I went to Solana's house and office and took physical measurements.  This is idiotic and he has turned Wikipedia into an idiotic circus.

If you have any idea of what Blank's Pond is, you know what I mean by sewage accumulation pond. All it is is a muddy puddle about 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. Maybe it was once used for ecological studies, but not in 10 years. Many parts of the original article drastically misrepresent what TAS is. There is no olympic sized swimming pool, the library is not close to rivaling that of a small liberal arts college. I just come to spread the truth.Allentchang, the point is that there are a rather large number of crimes at TAS versus the rest of the Taiwanese schools and it has often been the subject of Taiwanese media. I don't see how you can deny that. Yes, a lot of students go to the UC system, but that doesn't really say a lot, considering how poor the American education system is compared to the Taiwanese one.	0

btw there needs to be some serious fact checking on some claims such as.. does blank;s pond actually even exist anymore, or did people realize it was a mud puddle full of shit and fill it up a long time ago. Is TAS really non-profit>? NO! The college acceptance rate for the graduating class has always been above ninety percent.what does this mean? people from TAS get accepted 90% of the time? NO!Seriously, the censorship needs to go away. we've seen that TAS has sports facilities and a hot meal line. we also want to see what the taiwanese people feel about TAS because that is an important part of what TAS is. we need to publish the incidents that are so important to TAS. juz cuz you think it givves TAS a bad name doesn't mean that it shouldn't be published. if its true, then fuck, let there be light. this censorship shit is really really gay.  	1

`==Concerns over Tom Walker==A full two paragraphs is spent discussing Tom Walker's ``rebutal`` of the relatively common position that work-week restrictions are not effective against unemployment.  I was instantly left wondering, who is Tom Walker.   Tom walker turns out to be a social policy activist   (Yes, I'm pretty sure I have the right Tom Walker).  His rebutal has not to my knowledge been published in a peer reviewed journaland my opinion, as a PhD candidate, is that it is riddled with enough errors of logic as to not even merit consideration as reasonable dissent.  Unfortunately, Mr. Walker is so obscure, I can't find anyone who has taken the time to critique him in a peer reviewed journal eitherwhich isn't surprising given that his paper was never published in an accepted journal.  As much as I'd like to include some real argument against the commonly held position of economists, I don't think this Tom Walker stuff passes muster to merit inclusion.  I intend to delete the paragraphs relating to him.  I invite people to come forward with information suggesting that* Tom Walker is actually a figure of merit, qualified to have so much prominence in this article.* has published his rebutal in a generally accepted peer reviewed journalAlso, if people have any replacement suggestions.  Please speak-up.   `	1

`==One-sided debate?==I would like to engage Pollinator on his claims that I am ``rewriting`` my opponents viewpoints. The following things should be considered: 1) Wikipedia has one viewpoint, that of an encyclopedia. No part of no article can be said to be off-limits to editting.2) I have tried to be reasonable with Ungtss (the editor of the article who is trying to impose his own POV). As it currently stands he wants to have a ``counterpoint`` defense against the criticisms section. This is unacceptable because there will be no end to the point-counterpoint style of an article. If he wants to make points, let him do it in the article itself.3) Two of the arguments are not only specious, they're based on poor research on the part of Ungtss. I have explained this all above.Therefore, it is unreasonable for you to revert the edit which has added quality to the page.  `	1
`I am sad and disappointed by the website and will not contribute to it anymore nor pay much attention or give credit to the this so-called encyclopedia which is a sorry amalgam of U.S.-British prejudices. This is most highly unacceptable with regards to the page on Japanese war crimes. Millions of Chinese and Koreans were tortured to death in Japanese concentration camps. My father was an eyewitness to some of the atrocious war crimes committed in Singapore by the Japanese army and it haunts him to this very day. I cannot believe that due to Japanese economic power, both British and Americans call the Japanese War Crimes ``biased``, as if these were only one point of view. Worse still, the page on Nagasaki does not fully highly the effects of the Nagasaki bombings on Japanese children who were born malformed even many decades later. Technology is controlled by the rich and developed countries and the political truth amended to conform to those in power. I now know first hand how history writing works and will never believe a single words of it. All history are lies.`	1

I hate to disagree with you Ran but that is completely incorrect, the Chinese vernaculars did not start shifting at that time. You can do more research by looking up Middle Chinese and Classical Chinese. The Mandarin never altered the King sound to Jing sound as quickly as that. Most of the colonial invasion came from the Southern Coasts in those days, thus, they romanised from Cantonese and Minnan. Kirin is romanised according to the dialect around Jilin at a different stage that is why it is not calle Katlam. By the way, you are really offensive by blocking me yesterday. You did not read the regulations on Wikipedia that you are not supposed to call users who are newbies Vandals. That is an abuse of your privilege. I notice a lot of experienced editors here who like to block and delete the text contributions of newbies are really mean. Why are educated people so mean? This is a free world and we all have a privilege to speak out part but should also listen to others and not be so quick to censor others.	1
== Vandalism Policy ==Hey RanPerhaps you should re-read this paragraph. Do not impose your deletions on anymore newbies. That will discourage people from contributing to this site, especially vital for non-Chinese speakers learning about Chinese culture. If you like dominating viewpoints, fine, but you are welcome to write and publish your own book or even your own website. Thank you. Good luck.NPOV violations The neutral point of view is a difficult policy for many of us to understand, and even Wikipedia veterans occasionally accidentally introduce material which is non-ideal from an NPOV perspective.

Whether it is innovative or not is in itself controversial. POV.	1
.It is Nanking and Peking, not Pakking and Namking because you are confusing these early romanisations with the Jyut Ping which is a later linguistic invention. They are also not all romanised according to English. The British invaders came the last. They were first romanised by an Italian Missionary called Ricci and then by the French missionaries. That is why Guangdong is written as Canton. Canton was never meant to be an English romanisation. If you pronounce it in French, it sound exactly like the Cantonese pronunciation of it, even today. Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant. Do not be so quick to dismiss what you do not know or understand because one day when you need someone to understand you when you are old ugly and lonely, others will also dismiss you in the same way	1

Hello RanThanks for the comprehensive message justifying your pride in the Northern China. I find all your articles on China very selective and BIASED and your block people whose opinions and facts of China confirm otherwise. I won't block you because I am better than that.

`Many see the rise in Western Europe of what they call the ``new anti-Semitism`` as even more worrisome. Since serious Israeli-Palestinian fighting began in the fall of 2000, there has been a spike in harassment and vandalism targeting Jews, especially in France. Much of that is in poor communities where immigrant Muslims and immigrant Jews from North Africa live side by side. Unemployment and frustrations are high. Arab satellite stations, as well as European news networks, broadcast a steady stream of reports on Palestinians under fire, their homes destroyed, their lands reoccupied, their children killed. There is also, in many parts of Europe, a residue of the old racist attitudes that spawned the Fascist and Nazi policies of the 1930s. One of the presidential candidates in France's upcoming elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen, skirts the limits of the law baiting both Arabs and Jews...`	1

Also, just FYI, Yuber is guilty of four Reverts today (in violation of 3RR). I'm not reporting him on it but THAT is the reason I called him a Revert Monkey: his tendency to revert pages OVER and OVER and OVER protecting his own POV-laden edits.	1
`:::Yuber, whether the WORD Mutaween is used or not is immaterial. The concept of a division of police - whether folded into the normal police forces or their own separate entity - dedicated to the enforcement of religious law IS in place in Nigeria, Sudan, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. What about the phrase ``in varying forms`` are you having trouble understanding? `	1
==3RR==Just out of curiosity, have you ever considered RESEARCHING complaints before throwing out bans willy-nilly? 	1
`::::Right here, POV pusher. ::::Also Here.::::Zamfara state maintains an ``Islamic Unit`` similar to Saudi Arabia's ``Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,`` otherwise known as the Muttawa religious police. One of its officials, Alhaji Bello Kuceri, defended their practice of raiding Christian quarters to enforce ``Islamic`` standards on the grounds that ``we are paid to do so, and anybody caught will face the wrath of the law.``::::Get it YET, Yuber?`	1
Eagle, he's just a POV pusher. He was trying to strip the information out of the article, and started chain-reverting in order to do it. He's STILL lying and saying that the only Muslim nations with religious police are Saudi Arabia and Iran. Either he's just willfully ignorant or he is deliberately trying to push a very specific POV, and he seems not to care at all about facts. 	1
== I don't try to win many friends ==I simply reverting ALL edits by Turkish User:Tabin, because I try to give him a lesson of tolerance. My goal is simple: sooner or later he will request page protection on all of the articles related to his TPOV (Turkish Point of View). This is the only way to help him understand the nature of NPOV. To reach this goal I have big pool of different IP addresses, which I am going to use to cut any of his edits, no matter what his POV is...  	1
::: Gimme a break, these are HOT DOGS not frankfurters.   They've been called HOT DOGS for a century or so.   Just as we wouldn't change French Fries to Freedom Fries cause Georgie B says so we also aren't going to change HOT DOGS to some out-of-date hickville term like frankfurters cause some bloke down underwhere says thats what his mommy calls them.   Times change, buddy.   And Australia has a grand total of 20 million people, half of them speaking English as a third language.	1
====Yuber====Please do something about Yuber's constant vandalizing of pages - in addition to the Dhimmi page, he also continues to push his own POV edits in Saudi Arabia, ignoring the fact that his edits were rejected in dispute resolution. There are a few other pages he's pulling the same garbage on as well. 	1
`::Really the burden of proof is on the person who uses the word and that proof is dead simple.

Perhaps you would not be able to open that silly mouth for so long, ask older people, ask the tortured and the imprisoned, they are not so few, they are hundreds, and they really noticed the change. I want to remember the Fascism just because I don't want it back, it's not any stupid obcession...

`== My recent revrt/un-revert ==I'd like to publicly apologize for my recent reversion/unreversion of this article. The Wiki watchlist showed me a detrimental difference that was not, apparently, really there; I reverted this difference, but then I went back to check the history to see which was the ``truest`` version to revert to. Whereupon I discovered that I was apparently mislead in the first place, so I unreverted my reversion.

`== Adding percentages to the table ==I just tried to add the percentages of the seats in parliament to the results table. But that didn't work - I just messed up the table. And because at the moment there will still be many people who want to look that up I quickly reverted the change. The problem is that, as I understand it, before seeing the preview in this page, the Template:Election_Summary_Party first needs to be changed - really changed, not just a preview. What I did was addalign=``right`` |  |afteralign=``center`` |  |Then I changed the entries in the table, for example for the first one (Labour) I added|%          = 55.2after the seats-entry (see below for a more complete example (that one's for an extra row)). But that didn't work. I suppose I need to alter another template, but I don't know how and I don't have the time now to research this. Hopefully someone else can do this in a whiffy. Or is there an easy explanation?Here are the percentages:Labour Party (UK)  55.2Conservative Party (UK) 30.5Liberal Democrats (UK) 9.6United Kingdom Independence Party 0Scottish National Party 0.9Green Party of England and Wales 0Democratic Unionist Party 1.4British National Party 0Plaid Cymru 0.5Sinn Féin 0.8Ulster Unionist Party 0.2Social Democratic and Labour Party 0.5RESPECT The Unity Coalition 0.2Scottish Socialist Party 0Veritas (political party) 0Alliance Party of Northern Ireland 0Scottish Green Party 0Peter Law 0.2Socialist Labour Party (UK) 0Liberal Party (UK, 1989) 0Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern 0.2Socialist Green Unity Coalition 0Notice that the discrepancies between the percentages for number of votes and number of seats is often quite substantial. For example, the Labour party got 35 % of the votes but 55 % of the seats (mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats). Quite a difference! Especially since this means an absolute majority in parliament. That is what I was mostly interrested in when I came to this article. But that info wasn't there, so I had to do the calculations myself. And having done that I thought I might as well add it to the table. It is too important a thing not to point out.To do the calculations I had to add the figures up. Having done that I thought I might as well add that to the table too, but I already got stuck with the first bit. Only the totals for the number of seats and votes make sense, but what I had in mind was this:  |party      = TOTAL  |seats      = 645  |%          = 100  |gain       = -  |loss       = -  |net        = -  |votes      = 26,913,618  |%          = 100  |plus/minus = - 12:08, 2005 May 13 (UTC)`	1
Update:  May 13, 2005:  SqueakBox has made damaging inferential admissions on my own blogspot, www.cumbey.blogspot.com that he fabricated items in various stories he has composed about Javier Solana either here or on his various other internet stalkings seeking to erase all negative references to Javier Solana on the whole worldwide web (a daunting and challenging task!).  He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.  What was fabricated was Squeakbox's claim that the evidence (and website links were posted at the time) did not exist.  J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.  Below are just a few of many links proving that contrary to SqueakBox's bold assertions, Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana in July 2004! 	1

This is not a site to transmit Turkish denmilait propoganda any more then the Holocaust entry legitimizes Nazi false claims against the Jews. The level that the Turkish side approaches this issue is - for the most part - entirely unworthy of serious discussion - as it certainly is not presented as such. The issue here is first and foremost presentation og the Armenian Genocide - an event that did occur and is acknowlwedged as such by practically every serious scholar who is familiar with is - including an overwhelming number of Holocaust scholars. I agree that the current article is seriously lacking in context and detail - however a presentation that attempts to disprove the Genocide by offering up Turkish justifications and denials is a diservice to the truth and has no place here.  `	1

`=== Removed Personal Nerd Fluff ===Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to ``kiboze``). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.== External link ==*Kibo's website`	1

`== Last Paragraph of Clay Aiken's Wikipedia Commentary/Accomplishments ==Everything that has been written about Clay has been a wonderful and a true listing of his accomplishments. These are FACTS.  The SPECULATION about his sexuality is NOT A FACT - so why include it in this document at all.  What a let down at the end of the report to even mention the SPECULATION of him being Gay, which leaves such a negative assumption/suggestion after all the truly wonderful accomplishments previously listed.  Yes, Clay has denied the fact that he is Gay, why not just believe him!  That topic just does not belong with his accomplishments listed on Wikipedia.Furthermore, Clay is a Christian.  He openly discusses his faith and credits his accomplishments to Gods plan for his life. A true Christian believes only in the union between a man and a women.  Clay is NOT GAY.  Get over it!  Those comments just have no place here!I wish you would just write about Clay as the wonderful, caring and ``want to make a difference`` kind of guy that he is.

Assume good faith (even when you are pretty sure that the other person is not acting that way). Never revert first. Don 't make or respond to personal attacks. If the other person is trying to make things heated try mediation. Following this lot can result in two outcomes: a. It ends up in arb comm and your case is unasible. b.your opponent adopts these tactics and you end up collaborating on the article.]If that only solved the loophole problems that exist by manipulating prejudice and other things on here which go unnoticed by all except those accused of vandalism or trolling.  I wish that we didn't have to deal with veiled supremacists, but they always try to achieve your trust.

`Hogging articles is not against the rules per se(or is it?), as is not(or is it?) also reverting any single thing for power over that info.  You have found a loophole and you've gone to exploit that weak jugular.  I will never concede to your pressure.  Anybody who is not Jewish and knows about Puritans I will converse with on this article, because I want it to be fair and balanced.  Apparently, the fact that this includes the topic of ``Jew`` offends every Jewish person here unless a Gentile or Goy gets your express permission prior to editing.

`== US emissions description is totally contentless now. ==The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.Regards:Tamas Feher from HungaryE-mail: ``etomcat@freemail.hu```	1

Do you think that real nation builders have the stomach for low life crap artists like the Emperor of Atlantium? doesn't want Fifth World (5W) nations mentioned, and the reason he doesn't is perfectly logical in his praying mantis-like brain: it's the only way his foolish, immoral, and useless nation can compete with the likes of a 5W nation. He doesn't like the 5W not because it is ``incoherent drivel,`` but because it is the very opposite. Read this article to get an education, if you still care about getting one on the subject: TTF-Bucksfan related news.If his article on the Empire of Atlantium hasn't been voted for deletion yet (Sysops can do that, not me), and I have no evidence that it was, nor that it could possibly survive such scrutiny, then what's my purpose here? It is certainly not to write a better and more comprehensive micronational article!I have better things to do with my life, and I'll just write my own articles in my User file, where they don't bother nobody seeking publicity from the Wikipedia, and who finds the truth compromising to his success. I'll write my own articles if I feel like it.  can't make and will never make any real history with Atlantium, so he's chosen to do the next best thing: make his nation seem relevant in the Wikipedia, when in reality it isn't even relevant within the micronational community. == Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics ==Hi Rick,I wrote this quickly today following roughly how somebody had started the Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Are you in the process of substantially narrowing down the category, or is there another reason that you feel that they do not belong in it?  Thanks for the response. I looked through 63.231.226.163's user history and he/she does seem to be making the category way too broad. This is quite a problematic category; go ahead and scrap the category altogether if you wish.

** That about sums up what started this discussion in the first place.  On entries for railroad presidents I was adding the railroad name and years of the subject's presidency.  Now for some entries, such as for Ralph Budd (president of GN and CB&Q;) or for John W. Barriger III (president of Monon, P&LE; and MKT) or more recently for Mike Haverty (president of ATSF and KCS), this description could get quite lengthy as the managers moved around to different railroads.  For links to bios that have not yet been written, this information could be helpful for a potential editor to find information on the subject in order to write the bio.  However, after reading the comments above, I'm more inclined to agree on a minimalist description to keep the list uncluttered.  Separate list pages (such as one I'd been thinking about creating, List of railroad presidents) can go into more detail listing the information that we would otherwise have put into this list.  Personally, it doesn't matter much to me, but since a convention has been described, it's easy enough to follow.  	1

`==Eisenhower and McCarthy==Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of ``perhaps'es``, but hopefully it's illumintating.:President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information. This may explain why Eisenhower was willing to leave McCarthy barking up the wrong trees.`	1

`== Objectivity ==I realize this is a very controversial topic, but this article is simply not objective enough, and simply demonstrates American public opinion. For example, it is commonly accepted OUTSIDE of the United States that the fourth aircraft was downed by the US military. It is possible that the US media has exercised self-censorship and so the American public doees not have access to this information, but deleting caveats such as ``the 9/11 commission determined that...``, or putting it under ``conspiracy theories`` simply destroys objectivity.Could we not have this article explaining that it reflects the 9/11 commission's determinations, and have a prominent link to ``Disputes with the official account``? This would, hopefully, avoid offending people's sensitivity to the subject by keeping controversies off the main page, but also thereby reflecting a wider opinion?`	1
`== Leaning a little left of neutral ==After reading just the second paragraph (regarding the UN), I have to say the facts are clearly one sided.  Isn't it true that the ``Oil for Food`` scandal would/has clearly influenced the members on the Security Council?  That the Members on the Security Council had very large economic interests in Iraq and would loose them if there was a war, and now the clearly vocal SG of the UN now being implicated in influence in the ``Oil for Food`` scandal.  These facts would clearly give the reader a better understanding of a possible reason why the UN acted the way it did.The last and final resolution did warn Iraq of possible military solutions, if it did not comply.  One could clearly argue whether this is relevant or not, but just declaring that the Security Council was against the war without the above mentioned is avoiding reality.-I stand corrected this whole passage leaves out many important facts.  It also includes many unsubstantiated facts, such as Iraqi civilian deaths, that just go beyond the pale.This passage clearly needs a complete top to bottom rewrite.:i agree that the part you cite isn't neutral, but i strongly disagree with the characterization of its leaning as ``left``. anyway, it looks like you're new here at wikipedia. that's no reason you can't jump in and be bold. go to it, and good luck. (you'll need it. heh heh.)  14:10, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)*I agree with you completelly. I'm glad you mentioned this on the talk page ahead of time as somebody who does lean a little left of center would certainly change your edits. This article needs to be rewritten. :Well, pick out a chunk that is the worst example of the POV you're objecting to, and either fix it, or, if you want to increase the odds that it will survive for a while, hammer out a suggested alternative here on the talk page.   ==Absence of declaration of war: police action==This article is titled 2003 invasion of Iraq, which is perfectly fine and NPOV, but to claim in the opening paragraph that it is a war is to miss the essential fact that there was and has been no such declaration of war. If it is a war then it is illegal, however if it is considered as a police action falling within the executive authority, then it may be given some legitimacy under emergency powers. Even so, insofar as we would commonly refer to the invasion as a war (like the Korean War, the Vietnam War, etc.) this was a preventive war, not a pre-emptive war, and this should also be stated.  :some quick points: the police action article is weak, and basically serves as a setup for somebody to call any undeclared war a ``police action``. that's euphemistic government-speak. whether a war is declared has no bearing on whether its a war. that's simple logic. if the distinction is important to you at the article outset, then simply call it what you appear to be claiming: an ``undeclared war``. however, then the problem is that it was declared, but by the president and informally, not by congress in any fashion. while ``undeclared war`` is a stretch, it's not nearly as much as ``police action``. further, the iraq war does not meet a rough criterion (``local``) of the wiki-linked police action article. a war against an entire country is not ``local``. ``police action`` is a government term, invented by presidential administrations and sycophants to pretend they hadn't violated the US constitution.:calling this a ``preventive`` war is about as POV as it gets. if you think ``preemptive`` is POV, then please remove that, rather than calling it something even more POV. and i'd caution against using phrases like ``more precisely`` as in the edits i reverted. that phrase, in both cases, was incorrect.  ::Since the president doesn't have constitutional authority to declare war, he cannot have declared it unless illegally. So you are saying it would be more NPOV to call this an ``illegal war`` than to call it a police action? I agree that undeclared war doesn't make sense. However, in common usage, it is a war, and most people won't immediately understand unless we say it is ``more precisely`` a police action. That is not POV, that is just clarification.:::straw man alert! and most people won't immediately understand what? no idea where you get the need to bring in this term ``police action``. it's nothing but a term that claims ``wasn't no war, holmes,`` while bodies are lying everywhere.

== observed instances ==instead of linking to talk.origins (which is obviously POV), can we cover the observed instances here, with our own citations to the appropriate papers, etc? -  	1

`::The scale info was there when I showed up at WP, dunno its origin. Scale model is kind of short now, and discussion of matters related to its key adjective seems completely relevant, so I'd vote for that. (The ``ing``s should redir to it to I think - one could go the other way, but stylistically I prefer articles about objects to be about the objects rather than the process of creating them.) Note that scale (measurement) briefly mentions model scales, but it seems more like a disambigger than a content article.  `	1
The fact that the Mesilas Yesharim was lauded by the Vilna Gaon is not irrelevant. It is the reason why it is considered the preeminent Mussar sefer in Lithuanian Yeshivos.Calling the Yeshiva ancient implies that it is outdated. That is simply an anti-Orthodox opinion. Are Lithuanian yeshivos the most active? It is debatable.	1

Yes, because the mother of the child in the case against Michael Jackson was studied in here motives and reasonings and judged upon her character just as harshly as Wacko Jacko himself.  Don't tell me to ignore it and incriminate myself.  I am going to continue refuting the bullshit that Jayjg keeps throwing at me.     	1
Unless a person named Buffalo Springfield was born in 1944, it would really be worthwhile to put the name of the band in parnes behind the person's name, so as not to confuse people.   	1
