`I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content,only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson,Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J.Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery(1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National ScienceFoundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math schoolteachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (laterlost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation ofcomplex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers frompairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives fromCLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater thanminuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standardmultiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) +(-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must actas a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying productrule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) =24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule.This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which Iinitiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math.Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The otheraxioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` SoCLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`	1

`: For the benefit of the many, let's elaborate on ``A clear misuse of Juran's assumption (...)``:: In manufacturing, systems are designed so that everybody contributes a pre-defined amount of work, especially in synchronous settings such as assembly lines. Nobody could argue for a Pareto distribution there.: In agriculture and mining, individual contributions are sometimes measurable (e.g. basketful of apples picked per person per shift). A for-profit organization seeks out ``good`` workers, so the bottom part of the distribution will not be represented at all. Family and community operations often find a way to gainfully employ persons with less strength (e.g. 11-year-old girls) or with disabilities (e.g. blind people), but their number is not large enough to warrant a Pareto distribution.: Which brings us to the only economic system many readers have experience of: The services sector. In it, there is a place for ``stars`` in fields like moviemaking and advertising, where moneymaking ability is so narrowly distributed that it can sustain not just an 80:20 modeling, but 90:10 and even 99:1 (think of the distribution of pay in the fashion modeling world).: In other service areas, such as software development, it has been argued (and many influential minds such as Frederick Brooks and Joel Spolsky have devised methods for measuring and quantifying this) that a top designer, programmer, or QA person is roughly ten times as effective  as an average one.:It can be agued that this observation distribution does not carry to other areas of computing such as system administration.: Finally, the difference between top waiters (or shoe salespeople) and average ones may not warrant any Pareto analysis.:  `	1

`Yeah, as I said, I didn't mean to intervene in the middle of your edits, and I'm sorry about that.  As to right and left wing, I agree the terms should be used with care.  But calling the Freikorps ``right wing`` and Lenin and the Communists ``left wing`` is not a particularly careless use of the terms, as far as I am aware.  If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it.  You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing.  But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.``  At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing.  As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists.  And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all.  And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)  I also didn't revert many of your wording changes, because I think that some of them actually do do a good job of making the article less POV.  `	1

`==Eisenhower and McCarthy==Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of ``perhaps'es``, but hopefully it's illumintating.:President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information. This may explain why Eisenhower was willing to leave McCarthy barking up the wrong trees.`	1

`::There is no difference in rhetoric. The quote that Jayjg took out of context was a citation from the Qur'an that Hamas uses (also out of context) to justify the killing of Jews. Zionists use similar tactics (that's where Hamas learned it) by quoting the Torah and Talmud to justify the killing of non-Jews. ``We must treat the Arabs like the Amalekites`` is a common sentiment among extremist Zionists. There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it. Zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children, imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-Jews in the name of their Jewish supremacist ideology and state.  `	1

So I think we should add Eurozone, referred to as EU or as Eurozone, with a footnote explaining that the EU on the whole is in flux, but the figure is accurate-as-possible for the Euro countries.  Does this work with you?`	0

btw there needs to be some serious fact checking on some claims such as.. does blank;s pond actually even exist anymore, or did people realize it was a mud puddle full of shit and fill it up a long time ago. Is TAS really non-profit>? NO! The college acceptance rate for the graduating class has always been above ninety percent.what does this mean? people from TAS get accepted 90% of the time? NO!Seriously, the censorship needs to go away. we've seen that TAS has sports facilities and a hot meal line. we also want to see what the taiwanese people feel about TAS because that is an important part of what TAS is. we need to publish the incidents that are so important to TAS. juz cuz you think it givves TAS a bad name doesn't mean that it shouldn't be published. if its true, then fuck, let there be light. this censorship shit is really really gay.  	1

I believe that the morning glory plant is a primary usage of the phrase, and should be at Morning glory, while keeping the disambig. article at Morning glory (disambiguation), and the movie's title has a capital 'G', and doesn't need '(film)' after it to disambiguate it, so it should be at Morning Glory, There has been a move request made regarding (part of) this issue. If you have no objections, I will move everything back to the way it should be.   	1

`==One-sided debate?==I would like to engage Pollinator on his claims that I am ``rewriting`` my opponents viewpoints. The following things should be considered: 1) Wikipedia has one viewpoint, that of an encyclopedia. No part of no article can be said to be off-limits to editting.2) I have tried to be reasonable with Ungtss (the editor of the article who is trying to impose his own POV). As it currently stands he wants to have a ``counterpoint`` defense against the criticisms section. This is unacceptable because there will be no end to the point-counterpoint style of an article. If he wants to make points, let him do it in the article itself.3) Two of the arguments are not only specious, they're based on poor research on the part of Ungtss. I have explained this all above.Therefore, it is unreasonable for you to revert the edit which has added quality to the page.  `	1

:The idea behind the nicotine patch is to deliver sufficient nicotine to your bloodstream to help alleviate physical withdrawal symptoms.  You won't get the same spikes in your nicotine level that you get with cigarettes, but you shouldn't have major physical withdrawal symptoms.  With the patch, the hardest part is getting over the habitual and psychological addiction of nicotine.  :Most of the patch systems allow the user to step down around week 6, going from 21mg/day to 14mg/day to 7mg/day.  Tapering the dose like this should allow for a smooth landing when you're done smoking and make physical withdrawal symptoms unlikely.  Dreams are a relatively common side effect from the patch, at least from me.  	0

`What I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation.  Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.Oh, incidentally, it would be a great help if you, and all contributors, made use of the ``edit summary`` section so that the rest of us can more efficiently keep track of who added/deleted what and for what reason.

`That's another relevant empirical question: if there really are millions of people who would be horribly offended by ``Christian mythology``, then perhaps it's justifiable to avoid the term even if it's otherwise a good term.  But if it's just a few oversensitive ninnies, and most reasonable people can come to accept the non-pejoritive use of the term if it's explained, then I see no reason to avoid it.  I rather like ``Scientific mythology`` personally, and wish it were restored.  LDC`	1

Assume good faith (even when you are pretty sure that the other person is not acting that way). Never revert first. Don 't make or respond to personal attacks. If the other person is trying to make things heated try mediation. Following this lot can result in two outcomes: a. It ends up in arb comm and your case is unasible. b.your opponent adopts these tactics and you end up collaborating on the article.]If that only solved the loophole problems that exist by manipulating prejudice and other things on here which go unnoticed by all except those accused of vandalism or trolling.

Hi Mav, could you please look at the Irish Houses of Parliament. I put images to accompany my text on there. I know they are probably too big (I don't yet have the ability to shrink images yet -( ) but cropping them would cut off important bits of the image. Everyone seems very happy with the contents and images, but some browsers and screens may have problems due to their size. I trust you completely, having seen the standard of your work and would welcome any help you could give to make the images more screen-friendly.

I realize that several people (apparently including Rama) have attempted to point to Israel's bombing of Osiraq as the catalyst for Iraq's nuclear program, but it just does not hold up to scrutiny. Iraqi defectors as well as the IAEA's post Gulf War investigations found that Iraq had a clandestine program dating back to the late 1970's. Most of Iraq's nuclear work was done at Al Tuwaitha. Although the IAEA had access to Al Tuwaitha, it was extremely limited with the majority of the complex off limits to IAEA inspectors because no “declared nuclear activity” was taking place there. Evidently Blix saw nothing wrong with this.For the section quoting (although I did not include the quote to avoid POV) Blix praising Iraq compliance on the eve of the Invasion of Kuwait and during the beginning of Iraq's crash bomb program: NuclearFuel, August 20, 1990	0

Spinner, Jimmy and the Candy Bandits pick on him the worst. Spinner and the CB rig on bucket of tar and feathers to fall on him when he is on stage, ala the movie Carrie. Rick snaps, brings a gun to school and shoots Jimmy. Soon after, Rick dies in a fight with Sean.  	1

I don't like the last paragraph. Holding that you have some particular negative right doesn't mean that you believe that you have a right to make others protect you from having that right violated. That would mean you had double standard, in that you say you have negative rights, but someone else doesn't and therefore it's ok for you to coerce him to protect your negative rights. This would be an akward position to hold, and i doubt many people do hold it. So, I'm thinking about deleting the paragraph. (RJII) Dec 23 2004	1

* Yes, that was rather hasty of me -) I like the idea of having some standard clip art to use; it'd give a nice level of consistency to crypto articles. The reference site you gave me has good ones; I especially like the meat grinder for hash functions. John Savard's site looks like a wonderful resource - we should get him into Wikipedia! The M-209 looks like it could be a great challenge, but it'd likely require a lot more reference material than is readily available on Google. Ideally, I'd have a replica sitting next to me to model from; I'll peek around the web and see if I can turn up anything useful, though. If you know of any books I might find at the local library that would aid me, let me know. For now, I'll see if I can put together some basic clip art, and see whether I can wrap my head around AES before trying to illustrate it.   	0

`:: First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).    ::*``Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.``  ::*``On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``   ::The Mitchell Report:::*``Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``  ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right. ::``* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded.::* August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day.::* September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. ``::Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  `	1

`I am sad and disappointed by the website and will not contribute to it anymore nor pay much attention or give credit to the this so-called encyclopedia which is a sorry amalgam of U.S.-British prejudices. This is most highly unacceptable with regards to the page on Japanese war crimes. Millions of Chinese and Koreans were tortured to death in Japanese concentration camps. My father was an eyewitness to some of the atrocious war crimes committed in Singapore by the Japanese army and it haunts him to this very day. I cannot believe that due to Japanese economic power, both British and Americans call the Japanese War Crimes ``biased``, as if these were only one point of view. Worse still, the page on Nagasaki does not fully highly the effects of the Nagasaki bombings on Japanese children who were born malformed even many decades later. Technology is controlled by the rich and developed countries and the political truth amended to conform to those in power. I now know first hand how history writing works and will never believe a single words of it. All history are lies.`	1

=====John, I can't add to the Nazism and socialism talk page because it's not sectioned and too long for my browser.The point is that there is a debate on whether or not nazism is a form of socialism and the only way to write an article on the matter is to outline both sides of the debate. Taking out the competing debating points, in fact, makes the article NPOV by presenting the topic as if there is one right answer. And I'm sorry, it's just ahistorical to say that conservatives opposed Nazism. Some did, but most didn't, most notably von Papen. The Nazis didn't win an electoral majority. The only way they were able to take power was with support from the centre and right.	1

`I cut the following paragraph, which misleads people about biology::A few points are worth clarifying about ``nature`` and ``nurture``. First, ``nature`` does not reduce to anything as simple as ``present at birth``. Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.The problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.The real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.I believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `	1

`NOTBELOW IS ANOTHER OF SQUEAKBOX'S LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS:  I have absolutely no control over what others put on their board.  What Mr. Van Nattan writes are his own thoughts.  My book was the standard reference of the 1980s on the New Age Movement.  I disagree with Mr. Van Nattan on many items, including what I consider Catholic bashing.  For anything written by him to be imputed to me is untrue and unfair.  This is as logical as SqueakBox imputing to me every IP address disagreeing with SqueakBox from anywhere in Michigan (i.e. Allen Park, Michigan, where I have probably been maybe 3 to 4 times in my career as a lawyer and no other contact  certainly I have no IP address emanating from Allen Park, Michigan.  The Detroit metropolitan area has at least 3.5 million residents.  Equally ridiciulous is imputation to me of things fro Reston, Virgina, and his biggest stretch was that if it came from Toronto, it had to be Cumbey as that is ``so close to Detroit``.  Clearly his major was not USA geography.  As far as ``original research``  my research on Solana was all culled and distilled from other works.  Synthesizing this is what encyclopedic research is about.  I don't know what SqueakBox is talking about as original research.  Does he mean I went to Solana's house and office and took physical measurements.  This is idiotic and he has turned Wikipedia into an idiotic circus.  I'm happy that he has nothing better to do with HIS time.  As for me, I must practice law for an honest living!`	1

My position is that the assumption that C14 levels have been fairly constant is a reasonable starting base for dating items.  However, this assumption is not necessary because of the existance of calibration curves.  Basically, we get almost the same namers from calibration curves that we get from just assuming that C14 levels have been constant for the last 10,000 years.  We have two independent ways of getting at the same data.  The chances of both methods giving us mostly the same data by pure chance is really small.   	0

Romanian is very different from Dalmatian, so they probably developed in distant regions. This suggests that Romanians could not have come from the western part of the Balkans (including Albania). - I think that this argument should be entirely removed as it definitelly is not argument against theory of migration from south, but barely from Dalmatia (nobody claims that Vlachs arrived from Dalmatia).

==Thomas the Tank Engine==Hi: I have been looking at some of your edits and, where I can, I have added sources.  You could help us by doing this yourself as you make the changes.  In some cases you made deletions that I did not understand and there was no explanation on the discussion/talk page or in the summary.  If you are deleting something because it is wrong plese explain your reasons in the edit summary. If your changes are reverted and you disagree with that reversion please start a discussion on the talk page.  You have made a lot of constructive changes on other subjects too. Have you considered registering?   	1

`Totalitarian and dictatorship are two words with meaning and indeed are defined at length on Wikipedia with their own articles. Perhaps we should delete the articles, because no regime could ever qualify. That is not what neutrality means. The USSR qualifies under those definitions, under the vast majority of non-Marxist scholarship (we have already dealt with the sources issue at length), as reflected in Britannica and Encarta which both deal with the former USSR at length and very adequately synthesize that scholarship into long articles. Also, earlier versions of this article included the terms and were edited out. I encourage those interested to go back and see what went on previously. The issue is whether ``totalitarian dictatorships`` are non-neutral language. I don't think they are non-neutral at all.  The words have meaning, I think Fred has written at length on how the USSR qualified and I defer to his effort. Perhaps someone should post it up here. Now is the time to resolve it. `	1

`Many see the rise in Western Europe of what they call the ``new anti-Semitism`` as even more worrisome. Since serious Israeli-Palestinian fighting began in the fall of 2000, there has been a spike in harassment and vandalism targeting Jews, especially in France. Much of that is in poor communities where immigrant Muslims and immigrant Jews from North Africa live side by side. Unemployment and frustrations are high. Arab satellite stations, as well as European news networks, broadcast a steady stream of reports on Palestinians under fire, their homes destroyed, their lands reoccupied, their children killed. There is also, in many parts of Europe, a residue of the old racist attitudes that spawned the Fascist and Nazi policies of the 1930s. One of the presidential candidates in France's upcoming elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen, skirts the limits of the law baiting both Arabs and Jews...`	1

“She was the editor of a literary page in the school's paper[...]”Can anyone find out what the school paper was called?:“In later years her health has been uncertain; she was forced to move to Florida in November 1966 and now lives in Tennessee.”Does this mean we don't know about her health or that it was variable? Who or what forced her to move to Florida and how was she then able to move to Tennessee?:“Often called the Grande Dame of Science Fiction and Fantasy[...]”By whom?:“She has had a profound influence on the entire genre”Do any other authors cite her as inspiration? Are there sales figures or awards to back this up?I think answers to any or all of these question would help fill out the article. I found this article through Special:Randompage. If anyone feels like answering some of these questions I'd invite you to answer this one while you're at it: which of her books should I read first? —  	0
`It's worth noting somewhere that the term ``sustainable`` or ``sustainability`` is heavily deprecated among Greens and especially Gaians for implying some kind of steady-state output.In other words, ecological yields vary, and can be maximized but will still vary considerably with weather patterns, insect migration paths, and etc... they can't be made as uniform as outputs of a factory - which almost seems to be the goal of ``sustainability``.Also, to say something is ``sustainable`` or ``not`` implies that there is some actual test for it.  Which there isn't.  It's all a matter of scenarios and guesses.The ``Limits to Growth`` type of numerical modelling, largely discredited now, was the actual origin of the ``sustainable`` paradigm.Today ecologists are far more concerned with homeostasis, keystone species, and homeorhetic process, none of which benefit much from external measures of ``sustainability``.Complex problem.  Don't pretend to have an answer or a clear altnerative term.`	1

::Have to disagree with Mcarling here.  Hagelin was supported by large factions within the Reform Party, most prominently that Mangia fellow and Lenora Fulani, because of their (in my opinion, unwarranted, but that is irrelevant) desperation to avoid Pat Buchanan's nomination.  When I voted in Illinois, John Hagelin was listed on the ballot as Reform, whereas Buchanan was listed as Independent, because the state party refused to go along with (the larger of the two factions of) the national party and supported Hagelin.  The Hagelin faction made Mangia party chair, which can hardly be seen as an outside takeover, because he was already an officer of the party. -  	0

` Feb 2005 (UTC):::::::::I would like to know how you earned the title to decide who is ``a serious conservative`` and who isn't?  Also, how is that relavant to whether something is NPOV or not?  I don't think your comment has anything to do with what is NPOV, but I am absolutely sure that your comment indicates that you are bias.  It doesn't matter if Byrd was a Kleagle 60 years ago or 50 years ago or if was a Kleagle in 2001 when he was talking about ``White N****.``  The fact that he was a Kleagle is the probably one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits that himself when he tells other potential Kleagles not to become Kleagles because the whole Kleagle thingeven if you are like Byrd and think the Kleagle thing is coolwill hurt you because guys like me (the supposedly UNserious conservative) will remind him of his Kleagle days every chance that I get.  Byrd was a Kleagle and that is one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits the fact that his Kleagle-ness has held him back to bigger and better things.  And don't argue that he didn't want bigger and better things than to be the head Kleagle from West Virginia.  He did run for the Presidency and the whole Kleagle surely couldn't have helped.  You like the guy, so you want to minimize the Kleagle thing, but it would NOT be NPOV because that's who Byrd is:  the oldest, highest ranking Kleagle still in politics.  Head Kleagle.  Grand Kleagle of the Senate.  El Demo Grande Kleagle. 03:24, 16`	1

`==Britain==:When the Romans took control of the largest island they called their possessions Britannia. The earlier celtic inhabitants became known as Britons and the island as Britain. Some centuries after the Romans had left, some of these Britons migrated to the near continent. About 1000 years later (i.e. by the late Middle Ages) the region they had moved to was known as Brittany, and to distinguish the island the term Great Britain was used (compare the French names Bretagne and Grande Bretagne). After the fall of the Roman Empire, the name largely fell into abeyance and tended to be used in an historical sense. Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively.Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain? Geoffrey of monmouth comes before Roman departure + some centuries + 1000 years, so his use of Britannia major (= Great Britain) is the first use of it in the article, not a revival or historical use of a name ``in abeyance``.  `	1

`== US emissions description is totally contentless now. ==The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.Regards:Tamas Feher from HungaryE-mail: ``etomcat@freemail.hu```	1

`Something I wanted to clarify about my last edit:I simply had a problem with the original post since it wasn't accurate. Gas chambers were specifically built for exterminating the groups mentioned in my edit. Jehova's witnesses and homosexuals were put into concentration camps, and surely mistreated beyond any measure conceivable to us. The fact remains though, that they presented a normal, and small portion, of those prisoner populations, and were not treated different than the rest of the prisoners. Jews, Sinti and Roma were people the Nazis specifically targetted for extermination as a people. Later on there wasn't even imprisonment for these people, they were simply transported to the death camps.A Jehova's witness could have saved its life by denouncing its community's faith and agreeing to be drafted to the Wehrmacht, a choice Jews didn't have. But this isn't my point and I'm not suggesting they should have done that.But the fact I want simply to put out by my edit, is:I've read about the Holocaust and the Euthanasia operation, I've read about the concentration and death camps, and the SS, Gestapo and SD ``security`` apparatus, but I didn't read about Homosexuals or Jehova's witnesses being specifically targetted for extermination by gas as distinct groups, maybe still as a part of the prisoner population, but not specifically. As a reference I want to suggest Eugen Kogons ``The SS state`` or the books of Raul Hilberg.`	1

`Please note that your comment that ``What you are saying is that YOU have never heard of Exeter. This is your problem. Perhaps you should read [1] and enlighten yourself. Whatever, my point remains that the word Exeter is most associated with Exeter in Britain, and this is the convention.`` is more insulting than my characterizing a tiny place of 100,000 as a ``jerkwater town.`` which it is! I know more about British geography than 99% of Americans - I remember in an online chat with some guy from Sheffield that he was surprised that I knew Sheffield was a city, as I was the first American he'd spoken to who had even heard of it. I think _you_ should enlighten yourself. You referred to a Google search that found most of the links to the name Exeter referring to the city in the UK. What proportion of those were from sites in the UK? If you can find even _one_ site anywhere that is put up by someone outside the UK that uses ``Exeter`` unqualified to refer to the one in England, and does not preface that with some reference to England, Britain, or the UK (to make it clear that he's talking about UK places!)

-As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen. Note that the five inner planets (excluding Earth) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life.	0

`Dear Squeakbox:  I have been very polite to you compared to your incredible persistent rudeness and use of three different identities upon me.  I have saved your entire string of correspondence, so have at it!   If I recall correctly, you threatened me with a Honduran jail for ``vandalising Wikipedia`` when I was the one who wrote correctly.  Moreover, I covered Solana's Spanish political career very thoroughly and you falsely accused me of not doing so.  It seems my biggest mistake was once writing ``Ferninand Gonazalez`` instead of ``Felipe Gonzalez`` which would have been a simple edit for you.  Instead, you launched an unseemly internet career of calling me ``a troll`` and a ``vandal`` among other things.  Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty!  If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs, I could make one fine case out of that, but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below.  Why don't you go pick on someone else!  CONSTANCE.`	1

`:::I feel like you're making the mistake of assuming I'm an anarcho-capitalist. I'm not, particularly. Nor am I unaware that both Rand and the Libertarian party are wary of the label anarchist - just as wary as many left anarchists are of anarcho-capitalism. It's an uneasy relationship. The article should describe that. But the relationship is there - plenty of people accuse Rand of being an anarcho-capitalist, regardless of her denials of that fact, for instance. And plenty of people accuse the Libertarians of that. I mean, I think the umbrella label ``anarchism`` is a problematic one in a lot of ways - particularly in how so many groups simultaneously want to claim the label and avoid the label. I think the article needs to make the dissent and controversy surrounding the word itself clear. And any evidence I've offered in this debate should be taken as evidence of exactly how unclear the word is.  `	0

** That about sums up what started this discussion in the first place.  On entries for railroad presidents I was adding the railroad name and years of the subject's presidency.  Now for some entries, such as for Ralph Budd (president of GN and CB&Q;) or for John W. Barriger III (president of Monon, P&LE; and MKT) or more recently for Mike Haverty (president of ATSF and KCS), this description could get quite lengthy as the managers moved around to different railroads.  For links to bios that have not yet been written, this information could be helpful for a potential editor to find information on the subject in order to write the bio.  However, after reading the comments above, I'm more inclined to agree on a minimalist description to keep the list uncluttered.  Separate list pages (such as one I'd been thinking about creating, List of railroad presidents) can go into more detail listing the information that we would otherwise have put into this list.  Personally, it doesn't matter much to me, but since a convention has been described, it's easy enough to follow.  	1
