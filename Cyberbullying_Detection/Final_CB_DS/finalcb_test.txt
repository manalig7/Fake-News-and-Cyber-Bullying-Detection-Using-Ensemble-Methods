You what? I can't build a consensus by chiding people who have different views from my own that they ought to show respect for others' views? I should build it by entirely disregarding their views? Jeez, man, I thought I was working on a wiki. Looks like I wandered into something completely different from that. : You feel that others are disregarding minority views.  I'm sorry that you feel that way.  Look at the comment I wrote when I reverted Anthony Dipietro's deletion of the picture.  Does it look like I'm disregarding the views of others?  Here is what I wrote. Anthony, I think it looks as if you may be attempting to revive the reversion war over the picture.  Nevertheless I'm open to persuasion if you can justify the removal of the picture.  I've reverted your edit for now because of an inadequate explanation, but would not revert a second time on this occasion. |]] ::A lot of others are disregarding minority views.  Just look at the poll.   	1

I removedThe modified adjacency matrix is generated by replacing all entries greater than 1 in the adjacency matrix by 1.from the article. The edges in graphs are defined as a set, so it is not possible that an edge (vi,vj) is contained more than once. I think the adjacency matrix should be a (0,1)-matrix and perhaps in a subsection someone could extend this definition to count the number of edges two vertices share. 	0

 Jan 2005 (UTC)::Generally, I don't acknowledge the comments of someone who goes out of his/her way to talk down to me.  Suffice it to say that the burden of proof is on you and the Democrats to prove that the Grand Kleagle is NOT a racist pig of a Senator.  He was the one who choose to join the Klan, it was he that choose to recruit new members to the cross-burning organization.  It was NOT me that made him do those things.  It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.  Why do you feel the need to defend the Kleagle?  Oh, by the way, I can't believe that I even responded to you.  I only responded because you are fellow Jayhawk, but I normally would not respond to comments of your tone.  I will continue to remove and edit any untrue information that you place in an article also.  Only 13 Senators voted against Rice.  That is 13% of the Senators.  That is not a large segment of the societyno matter how hard you try to make people believe that it is.  The one African-American Senator did not vote against her.  Only the most partisan Democrats voted against her.- 01:19, 31	1

== Longest running ==Surely the simpsons is the longest running TV show in the world!?  Shows like gun smoke may be repeated on a regular basis, but they were also axed many years ago...The first line of the article used to statte that it was the longest runnig animated sitcom in he history of 'US' television history. I changed this however to read 'television history' as there is no animated sitcom (that I have heard of at least) which can top it.  If anyone knows of one from anywhare in the world that can feel free to amend it.IU believe that it is the longest running 'sitcom' in television history and maybe even 'show'.  Can anyone think of a sitcom that has run for longer than this?  I feel I may change it to say 'sitcom in television history' and let people make amends to it if they know otherwise as this seems to be the best way to get things done on wiki.	1

`=== Removed Personal Nerd Fluff ===Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to ``kiboze``). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.== External link ==*Kibo's website`	1

===Earth Summit===Sorry for any problem with marking the edits as minor and I will review the guidelines. Part of the problem was that I had made a series of edits, each of which perhaps could have been considered as minor, however the cumulative effect was not. I expect to continue to work on this and related pages, as the UNCED process had been my life for almost three years leading into the conference, with a focus on information, communications & participation - a role that continued through the series of UN conferences of the past decade.Btw, I am planning to share information about Wikipedia and the Earth Summit, Agenda 21, etc. at the current session of the Commission on Sustainable Development in the hopes both of spreading the word about Wikipedia within the NGO community, and of eliciting wiki contributions to topics relating to sustainable development, so you may want to keep an eye on Earth Summit over the next couple of weeks.	0

*207.44.148.201 was  who forgot to log in. With the advent of personal computers and the internet, the 'third way' you talk about has become much more viable than in the olden days of typewriters and photocopy machines. Just look at what the 'third way' is doing to the music industry. That said, looking at self-publishing as a whole, I believe your success still represents a statistically-rate exception.:As far as POV, if it ain't NPOV, correct it. That's what Wikipedia is all about. Recognize, though, that writing about a subject with a perfectly NPOV can appear to have a biased POV to someone with a stake in the subject.  	0

`==Anon vandalism==Gidday Coolcat, I've looked at 's edits, and they are indeed vandalism. Since they were made by an anon without a history of previous vandalism, and they all happened within ten minutes and many hours ago, I doubt that anything would be achieved by blocked the IP address. I've placed a warning on their talk page, but the chances are, they'll never see it because they got bored with vandalising Wikipedia and moved on.When you warn someone for this sort of activity, please put your warning on their talk page, not their user page.

`From the Village pump:===Quote marks in article title?===I have created an article for ``Live free or die`` - the delightfully quirky state motto of New Hampshire. The question is: Should the title have quotation marks in it?I didn't put them in because it seemed weird, but since the title refers to the words as words rather than their meaning, maybe they should be there.I can't find other article titles that are phrases to act as guidelines, although that's probably just due to lack of imagination on my part. Any thoughts?-  15:04 27 May 2003 (UTC): It won't be an issue like that. You can't have double quotes in article titles. You can have single quotes in a title, but I wouldn't recommend it for this case, just the bare words. Furthermore, I would suggest having the actual article at State motto of New Hampshire, New Hampshire (motto), State motto (New Hampshire), or something like that, and Live free or die as a redirect to that.   15:10 27 May 2003 (UTC):: P.S. Hmm, judging by the single blue link I now see above, it looks as though someone else has pre-emptively disagreed with me, though. ;)   15:12 27 May 2003 (UTC):::There is, it turns out, already a List of state mottos page. I linked to Live Free or die from there. I'm not enthusiastic about titling the article some variant of New Hampshire (motto), since nobody cares about state mottos as such - in this case people are vastly more likely to have heard the phrase and want to find out about it, and IMHO the article title should reflect that approach. But I'm not wedded to the idea, since a search on the phrase would find the article either way   15:25 27 May 2003 (UTC): See Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (slogans), where some discussion/voting on the subject is under way. I recommend Live free or die, myself. `	1

`I'm going to remove the notion that the ecliptic didn't cross Ophiuchus before 1930, since it is clearly contradicted by this: OphiuchusThe story seems to be that before 1930, the area that now only belongs to Ophiuchus belonged to two or more constellations.In order to formalize it, astronomers had to choose one.If they choose one of the astrological signs, they would avoid angering astrologers.If they choose Ophiuchus, one of the most important documents in astronomy, Kepler's ``De stella nova in pede Serpentarii`` (On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot) would still be meaningful to future astronomers. They would also honor Kepler and Ptolemy who first described the constellation over 1700 years earlier.It comes as no surprise that they acted as they did. 01:18, 2005 Feb 24 (UTC)`	1

`== Introduction has been horribly POVed ==And that's just the beginning of a concerted effort that has badly slanted the entire article. I've been reviewing the history of the introduction and would like you to see how badly it has been degrading. It's really discouraging to see how this honorable woman's memory is being disgraced. I really would rather not be a part of it anymore so please feel free to carry on.    *The day after she was killed this was the full article:``Rachel Corrie (? - March 16, 2003), an American college student, was a member of the International Solidarity Movement protesting Israeli action in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. She was killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza. While speaking via a loudspeaker and wearing a red coat, in front of a physician's home which the Israelis intended to bulldoze, Corrie fell down. A bulldozer then ran over her twice. Later, as a group of people gathered, a man was shot and killed by the Israel Defence Forces. Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.``*A week after she was killed:``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes. She played soccer, gardened and loved the poems of Pablo Neruda. She was the daughter of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie, a school volunteer and flutist.``*April 2003:``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.*From December, 2003:``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American activist who was crushed to death when protesting Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip.As a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), she traveled to Rafah during the Al-Aqsa Intifada and tried to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Caterpillar D9 bulldozer. She was fatally wounded during this incident.``*From April 2004:Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003) was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who traveled to Rafah in the Gaza Strip during the Al-Aqsa Intifada. While protesting the Israeli occupation, she was was fatally wounded when she tried to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Caterpillar D9 bulldozer.Her death sparked controversy, with various advocates scrambling to blame it on the IDF, the ISM, ``Palestinian terror``, and on Corrie herself.*From October 2004:``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003 was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who was run over and killed by an Israeli soldier operated bulldozer while she was protesting Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes in Rafah in the Gaza Strip.Her death sparked controversy because she was a peaceful protester and a U.S. citizen, yet the U.S. did not conduct or even demand an official investigation and Israel has not held anyone responsible for her death.``*Yesterday:``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979—March 16, 2003) was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who was killed when she confronted an Israeli soldier-operated bulldozer while protesting Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes in Rafah in the Gaza Strip.     Her death sparked controversy, in part because she was the first Western protester and U.S. citizen to be killed in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and in part because of the highly politicized nature of the conflict itself.

`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room. ::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then. :If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads. ::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir. :You just can't make this stuff up, Danny. ::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. I am not making things up. I am simply stating things that (no matter how inconceivable it may be) you do not know. :Stop trying to re-make the ultra-Orthodox in your own image. Its not good history. Frankly, I don't care what is on your resume. It doesn't justify writing such nonsense.  RK: Personal attacks. I will say that your intellectual arrogance coupled with your apparent ignorance do not put you in a very good light. In my professional life, I have researched and written extensively on this field, developed relationships  both working and personal  with many of the people involved, and worked on several important documentary films on the topic. I think I have a sense of what NPOV is, and a statement that the ultra-Orthodox ``hate`` the non-ultra-Orthodox just doesn't make the mark. : Is beating the shit out of non-Orthodox Jews an act of love? Is calling them ``worse than Hitler`` an act of love? Is accusing them of creating the Holocaust an act of tolerance? Danny, you can protest all you like, but you obviously so immersed in an ultra-Orthodox worldview that you can't see the forest for the trees. This is violent hatespeech, and it frightens me to see an educuated person making apologetics for it. RK:: Then it must frighten you even more knowing that I was actually there (and on one occasion, actually hit). Why? Because I do not feel the same antagonism that you do? Because I see some distasteful remarks in a certain context? You say in your diatribe that you want everyone to sit together and sing a Shlomo Carlebach niggun. Just answer me this though? Would Reb Shloime have davened in a shul without a mehitza? Oh, and haredi does not mean ``trembling,`` as you originally wrote at the top of the article. In fact, that was kind of funny.

I am in agreement with your distaste at Ward Churchill putting himself forth as a spokesman for the Native community but even more at those who have accepted him as a spokesman, like the people at the University of Colorado who put him on a fast tenure track, bypassing others, most of whom were not even interviewed. However, judging from his appearance I do think he probably has some Native American ancestory and feel we should take his word for it. The real issues have to do with his actions and ideas.  ::Thank you for the response.  I don't disagree with his right to speak.  I don't agree with a lot he has to say, but that is irrelavant. He does have a First Amendment right to state it.  I just believe that he should be held out as an Indian, when he isn't.  That's all. And I don't believe that we should take his word for itconcerning his alleged Indian heritage.  I know that you have your opinion concerning that and that's fine.

`While I want to distance myself from the last statement by VMORO, which I would classify as rude, I can't help pointing out to you, Crculver, that you seem to have misunderstood what grammars and books have to say (or they themselves are inexact). That dialect is certainly Macedonian in the geographical sense of the word. However, if we take modern Bulgarian and Macedonian as a starting-point, the dialect has many more traits of Bulgarian than of Macedonian.You seem also to forget that it is politics that defines what is a language and what is a dialect and which dialects belong to a certain language, not vice versa. As regards the Slavic dialects of Macedonia, we have an almost universal acceptance of them as Bulgarian until 1918, then they become viewed as Serbian by most scholars, and we have actually started regarding the name ``Macedonian`` as a linguistic and not only geographical term since 1945. Quoting the synchronical aspects of a question is of not much of a use when you lack any knowledge about its diachronical development. `	1

::::I'm familiar with the part about No personal attacks and if you'll have a look at  or my contributions you'll find that I'm moderately familiar with how Wikipedia works.

. If changes are made that do not qualify as vandalism, and they are neutral facts, then hands off. Let others modify it, which is why the Wikipedia was made in the first place. Even a completely biased Revisionist page by a revisionist would serve as a better starting point than what is here, because it would allow an accurate summary of what they are all about, which could then be modified by others until it was NPOV	0

The Google server farm is thought to be the largest,>with a total calculation rate three times that of Earth Simulator or Blue Gene, as of 2004.This is bull-shit. Mainframe is still IBM's most profitable branch (literally billions of dollars earned), because banks and governments would never accept the inherent unreliability of PC-farms. Also, PC based clusters simply cannot have the vast I/O performance, traditional to mainframes, which these big brothers require. Without tremendous I/O bandwidht (e.g. serve 15,000 interactive users and six fully loaded ATM circuits at the same time) the CPU power is of little real-world use.	1

==Deletion votes and username==Thanks for the advice on the deletion votes - I'll try to be more descriptive of why I think these things should be kept. However, it was not my understanding that a vote would be discounted simply because no explanation was given.Re my username, while I understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls, my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral, accurate encyclopedia, creative and innovative approaches are helpful. I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible. Thanks for you advice, hope to see you around,  	0

`== Objectivity ==I realize this is a very controversial topic, but this article is simply not objective enough, and simply demonstrates American public opinion. For example, it is commonly accepted OUTSIDE of the United States that the fourth aircraft was downed by the US military. It is possible that the US media has exercised self-censorship and so the American public doees not have access to this information, but deleting caveats such as ``the 9/11 commission determined that...``, or putting it under ``conspiracy theories`` simply destroys objectivity.Could we not have this article explaining that it reflects the 9/11 commission's determinations, and have a prominent link to ``Disputes with the official account``? This would, hopefully, avoid offending people's sensitivity to the subject by keeping controversies off the main page, but also thereby reflecting a wider opinion?`	1

I'd best correct myself. I've noticed, upon further inspection, a distinct change in writing style in the offending paragraph. It does not invalidate the article that an angry person decided to throw in his two cents. I don't care for the paragraph, for it contributes nothing, but I don't feel comfortable editing the article myself.	1
`:::No, the ``problem`` is that you choose to infer the worst possible motives from any inconsistencies in Kerry's record, then assert the criticism as incontrovertible truth, and dismiss anyone who disagrees with you as being a ``Kerry sycophant`` or of whitewashing your self-proclaimed truth. Should the inconsistencies be mentioned? Certainly, if they are substantive. But different conclusions can be drawn from such inconsistenicies and we need to clearly distinguish between speculative conclusions and bare facts. ≠ : What about the link to ABC News and NY Times stories? Both of those sources confirm a set of facts that is different from what Kerry tells us is so... Alos, if my writing style offends you, why don't YOU write the new blurb, but this time INCLUDE the links to the articles which the others kept deleting out from under me....?:Oh and by the way, it's only your supposition that I choose to infer the ``worst``. As a matter of fact, by proclaiming my view to be the ``worst`` you betray your BIAS that anyone who highlights Kerry faults is somehow bad or wrong. What if it turns out that I am right about Kerry... that he has changed his story - that he is covering up for a guilty conscience, then what? Is it still the ``worst`` to believe something that's true?: Additionally, I can turn your comment around and ask, why is it that YOU prefer to believe the ``best`` about Kerry. Credulity does not impress me as a hallmark of a good editor. Frankly, if you can't see the glowing pro-Kerry tone of the total article, you are not very perceptive.: Not only that, but the disputed sections: 'Medal-Toss' and '1971 VVAW MTG', in the forms they stand now, are extrremely tilted in favor of Kerry. In particular, the VVAW secion is so chopped and convoluted in it's strain to only allow in quotes that help Kerry, that it's farcical.: You do see that, don't you?: `	1

:Oh, and incidentally, the Wikipedia guidelines for American vs British English say to use whichever is either most predominant in Wikipedia, or what applies best to the article or what the article is written in, in order of ascending priority.  Wikipedia is largely in American English, Gnome is an American project, and reading through the article, the only thing that I can find that is British English and not American, is precisely the word we are quarrelling over.  So I think I can safely say it should be 'organization', not 'organisation'. But I don't want a revert war, so I'm gonna drop it until I hear from you.

`::You have a serious problem here - how can anyone possibily define one single ``Jewish position``? . Regarding your claim that Hebron is a ``Jewish city`` - as you well know the Jewish community in Hebron has been a minority for hundereds of years. Calling it a Palestinian city makes no judgement on who should live there and who shouldn't because the term ``Palestinian`` is a nationalist term with no direct religious implications. I happen to agree with you that ``The State of Israel does not have the authority to decide what is a Jewish city and what isn't``. The question remains: considering that Palestinian Arabs make up the vast majority of the population of Hebron and that the government of Israel designates it a Palestinian city, what justification is there for calling it a ``Jewish city`` other than an explictly racist one?  `	1

** That about sums up what started this discussion in the first place.  On entries for railroad presidents I was adding the railroad name and years of the subject's presidency.  Now for some entries, such as for Ralph Budd (president of GN and CB&Q;) or for John W. Barriger III (president of Monon, P&LE; and MKT) or more recently for Mike Haverty (president of ATSF and KCS), this description could get quite lengthy as the managers moved around to different railroads.  For links to bios that have not yet been written, this information could be helpful for a potential editor to find information on the subject in order to write the bio.  However, after reading the comments above, I'm more inclined to agree on a minimalist description to keep the list uncluttered.  Separate list pages (such as one I'd been thinking about creating, List of railroad presidents) can go into more detail listing the information that we would otherwise have put into this list.  Personally, it doesn't matter much to me, but since a convention has been described, it's easy enough to follow.  	1

`Hi Euric - welcome to Wikipedia. About your recent edits to Floppy disk: Metric specifications are no 1 worldwide now, agreed. But that's not the point here. It's a fact that these floppies have been called 5¼- and 3½-inch and that has to be seen in a historical perspective. The fact that the 3½-disk is actually 90 mm in size has also been clearly stated in the article. (It might have been called a ``90 disk`` or something similar, if it was invented 10 years from now ) And even when using the metric system, you'll sometimes run into ``misnomers``; if you bought a 2½-litre car it is highly likely that it sports an engine with only 2,4895 litres of displacement.  07:36, 2004 May 21 (UTC)`	1

`::::You seem to be missing the point. This is not my personal argument. I am simply suggesting we mention that she was bulimic, a condition which she would have been largely responsible for and which was harming her. It is up to other to decide whether this is contradictory with the claim she would not want to do something to hurt herself.I also think another related issue that needs including is the fact that she would likely have not wanted to discuss the issue of her wishes not do want to be kept alive artificially with her parents and family if they were so vehemently opposed to the idea, especially given the fact it appears they never liked her husband and therefore were probably already disappointed with her as it is. Once again I should point out I'm not suggesting we include this whole thing. Simply something like ``she may not have wanted to mention her views to her family if they were strongly opposed to to this idea```	0

As an example of this practice, see Nintendo. If I had realized this page was up for moving, I would have supported it, however it appears I missed it. As is, six supported while four opposed, but as I mentioned above, two of those votes were contrary to the Manual of Style, leaving us with six supports and two opposes.

`Totalitarian and dictatorship are two words with meaning and indeed are defined at length on Wikipedia with their own articles. Perhaps we should delete the articles, because no regime could ever qualify. That is not what neutrality means. The USSR qualifies under those definitions, under the vast majority of non-Marxist scholarship (we have already dealt with the sources issue at length), as reflected in Britannica and Encarta which both deal with the former USSR at length and very adequately synthesize that scholarship into long articles. Also, earlier versions of this article included the terms and were edited out. I encourage those interested to go back and see what went on previously. The issue is whether ``totalitarian dictatorships`` are non-neutral language. I don't think they are non-neutral at all.  The words have meaning, I think Fred has written at length on how the USSR qualified and I defer to his effort. Perhaps someone should post it up here. Now is the time to resolve it. `	1

It is perhaps dangerous to defend science using the sort of naïve methodology presently described in scientific method. That methodology is, at the least, dubious. Better to point out that science is grounded in a shared, and powerful, understanding that allows us to manipulate the world in ways that no other enterprise can. The debate between post modernists and empiricists (for want of better terms) is ongoing, and it is not appropriate to pretend here that it is finished. Better to simply refer the reader to the relevant articles.  	1

Oh, and maybe check by searching for other articles mentioning him - there might be articles about specific books of him, so it makes sense to wikify the book titles. I'll contribute as well if I find the time.  	0

lyrics for You Should Have Killed Me When You Had The Chance ADTR  So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes I can hear you whispering as I walk by Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew This would make them change  The only thing that's going to bother me Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends  Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?  The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  Iu2019ve read these stories a thousand times  and now Iu2019ll rewrite them all Youu2019re meddling in an anger you canu2019t control She means the world to me  so hold your serpent tongue Is a whores lies worth dying for? I'll just take my time  The only thing that's going to bother me Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends  Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?  The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done  But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) But should I... ? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) You should have killed me when you had the chance You should have killed me when you had the chance	0

`Great start . I'm a ``newbie`` (a.k.a.: F.N.G.) to Wikipedia, so bear with me. I'd be glad to communicate with you on this article/subject. Here's why I've deleted/replaced a couple of your phrases/sentences:``...figurative language uses more poetic senses.``Although it's used a lot in poetry, figurative language is used in a lot more contexts than just poetry. When I shake my fist at someone on the freeway and call them an ``a__hole,`` I'm using figurative language (the figure of speech is synecdoche) without being poetic in any sense of the word.``In literal language, truth conditions work out well, while in figurative language, they may not.`` IMO the definition of terms in this sentence will be unclear to most general readers of an encyclopedia. What are ``truth conditions``? If it's a technical term, we'd better define it.Also, I moved the following to this page-== To add ==* Why would someone want to divide language into literal and figurative? What is gained thereby? (Lakoff provides some insight here.)* Why would people prefer not to view language with this divide?* How does this connect to theories of truth?``-These are all needed additions. The last one, especially, shows the importance and relevance of this subject to a broad range of disciplines, including theories of knowledge, cognition, language development, etc., etc.And now....here's an explanations for one of my suspect assertions -)``Some have boiled down the more than two hundred and fifty figures described in classical and traditional linguistics into two: metaphor and metonymy.``I know this from research, and my additions to Further Reading document reflect the ``classical and traditional`` end of this statement. But I need to go back and document which modern analyses have done the boiling specifically.  Tuesday, July 8, 2003, 12:45 CDT.`	1

::::::I do not have the book here with me at the moment.  Is it a Wikipedia requirement to not only provide a book but also page number and chapter number, etc?  That would put enough burden and responsibility on volunteer contributors to not be able to controbute in a practical way.  That would be the kind of detail you would expect from a well-paid staff such as the major commercial or academic encyclopaedias have (and even in their case, I don't think they provide page numbers or greater details, they just mention the source).  At any rate, this book is academic, authentic and well-respected.  Naturally, it is deeply hated by its opponents.   	0

`== ``Lab`` created Alexandrite Chrysoberyl ==   Synthetic alexandrite-like sapphires are produced by the Flame-fusion method using Vanadium Oxide as the chromophore or coloring agent. These stones have been manufactured since 1909 and are commonly marketed as a ``substitute,`` for genuine alexandrite chrysoberyl which is vastly more expensive. Experienced gemologists can detect these stones through simple use of magnification which reveals internal curved striae and sometimes gas bubbles which confirms their synthetic origin. The change of color is also unlike genuine or lab-created alexandrite.`	0

`*Paragraph one: if you are uncertain as to whether Lincoln was an important spokesman for the American System, why on earth would you be editing this article?*Paragraph two: I used the qualifier ``arguably,`` and I think it is justified to discuss the track record of the American System approach, which is now virtually unknown in its country of origin, to the track record of the other two options, which are normally the only ones discussed. Feel free to cite a success story for Marxism or Laissez-Faire. However, I agree that this paragraph might be better couched in a ``proponents of the American system assert a, and opponents respond with b`` format. I won't attempt to edit it, however, until we get arbitration, because you, Andy, and your cohorts, are in the ``revert, don't debate`` mode.*Paragraph three: simple statement of fact. Can you name another outspoken proponent of the American System, other than LaRouche? Remember, your dislike or LaRouche, or of the American System, is not at issue.

`== Condoleezza Rice censorship ==Hello Jewbacca. I am writing to inform you that I have some issues with your edits to my contribution to the Condoleezza Rice article. Although you claim that I ``poison the well with unneeded POV implications,`` I would argue that your ambitious language leaves too much open for interpretation and lets Dr. Rice off the hook. Having a NPOV doesn't mean censoring controversial ideas. For example, you removed ``criticized`` from the line ``Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for her boss...`` You make it sound like perhaps it is a good thing that She was out stumping for Bush instead of protecting the homeland. In addition, you removed another line I added that spelt out that there is a ``controversial`` link she perpetuates between Iraq and September 11th. The fact that this is even open for interpretation is beyond me. I believe my additions were in line with the NPOV policy and I have replaced them. It concludes with the actual quote so readers can pose their own stance. I am open to suggestions of maybe a better way to word my feelings on this topic. Please let me know.  `	0

You are an Admin, and you should look at this objectively. Otherwise the micronation article will only reflect the ideas/biases/knowledge of . That would not be a disservice to me, but to Wikipedia in the long-term. ==Reply==I replied to your message at . —  I responded to your question in Talk:Yoshitoshi ABe.

Do you actually think I even care at this point? If  hasn't been banned already with what he's done — just look at his micronation article, then look at mine at  — can you expect me to keep wasting my time with it? Do you think that real nation builders have the stomach for low life crap artists like the Emperor of Atlantium? doesn't want Fifth World (5W) nations mentioned, and the reason he doesn't is perfectly logical in his praying mantis-like brain: it's the only way his foolish, immoral, and useless nation can compete with the likes of a 5W nation. He doesn't like the 5W not because it is ``incoherent drivel,`` but because it is the very opposite. Read this article to get an education, if you still care about getting one on the subject: TTF-Bucksfan related news.If his article on the Empire of Atlantium hasn't been voted for deletion yet (Sysops can do that, not me), and I have no evidence that it was, nor that it could possibly survive such scrutiny, then what's my purpose here? It is certainly not to write a better and more comprehensive micronational article!I have better things to do with my life, and I'll just write my own articles in my User file, where they don't bother nobody seeking publicity from the Wikipedia, and who finds the truth compromising to his success. I'll write my own articles if I feel like it.  can't make and will never make any real history with Atlantium, so he's chosen to do the next best thing: make his nation seem relevant in the Wikipedia, when in reality it isn't even relevant within the micronational community. == Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics ==Hi Rick,I wrote this quickly today following roughly how somebody had started the Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

-The first paragraph of the 'notable characteristics' section states that aluminium is both soft and strong. This seems unlikely to be the case. In the case of pure aluminium the yield strength is in the region of 10 MPa which certainly isn't strong as far as construction materials are concerned (Al alloys may have yield strengths in the region of 200-500 MPa). As a result I have removed the word strong (alloying is mentioned later anyway).Surely aluminium is not resistent to magnetism but is simply non-magnetic? I have altered the 'applications' section to reflect this (and hopefully I'm right).The term 'weak' is ambiguous (strength, stiffness, hardness, toughness, fatigue resistance?). I replaced it with a link to tensile strength as this is probably the most familar mechanical property.	0

`:::Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words ``genus`` and ``species``, as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the ``monarchy`` category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   `	1

== Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==I edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.The Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.Which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.If you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.From what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else. 	0

.It is Nanking and Peking, not Pakking and Namking because you are confusing these early romanisations with the Jyut Ping which is a later linguistic invention. They are also not all romanised according to English. The British invaders came the last. They were first romanised by an Italian Missionary called Ricci and then by the French missionaries. That is why Guangdong is written as Canton. Canton was never meant to be an English romanisation. If you pronounce it in French, it sound exactly like the Cantonese pronunciation of it, even today. Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant. Do not be so quick to dismiss what you do not know or understand because one day when you need someone to understand you when you are old ugly and lonely, others will also dismiss you in the same way	1

`:Let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference I include below.::Prime Minister Blair is known in Britain as well as the United States for his personal closeness to US President Bush. The two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with Blair going against the Labour party as well as the majority of British citizens. In May, he backed the controversial Israeli withdrawal plan for the Gaza Strip, a radical departure from traditional British politics toward the region, and a move that put the British government in the position of being the only major nation besides the US to support it. He acquiesced to American requests in October to send Scotland's prestigious Black Watch battalion to Baghdad. Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.:The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.:The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others. :The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it.  `	0
` 2005 (UTC)::::Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what ``religion`` means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.::::Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.

`Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy::Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   `	1

****Familiar with the fallacy of confusing correlation and causation? Keep your original research claims out of the article... Further, your claim above does not offer any evidence against my revisions of your piece. Nothing in my revisions would serve to contradict that claim. This is just a diversion from the fact that instability in the region predated Castro's support of rebel groups and that guerrilla groups were also active going back before the 1970s.  	0

`:I'm backing this up with an argument, so I don't expect that you will revert these changes, based on your statement above.:I take issue with your position that the standard contemporary manner in which Latin is rendered is ``inaccurate.`` In addition, I don't believe that this is ``support[ing] the fiction that letters such as U existed, or that lower-case letters were used in Latin.``:Any Latin textbook, as well as my copies of Latin histories and poetry in Latin are all rendered with the v/u distinction (but not with j's, and not with macrons over the vowels outside of textbooks) and with lowercase letters, capitalization for the beginning of sentences and proper nouns, and with basic punctuation. It would be counterproductive and nonstandard (and not just for English text with the periodic Latin phrase thrown in now and then) for us to decide that any use of lattin must be in the 24 letter alphabet and in all caps. :And, by the way, I don't think it's very good form to set terms that must be met by others or else you plan to revert the article, since this isn't your article, Chameleon. :Thanks, | `	1

The cities are the same through the ages, but they have different names in different languages. In my opinion if a reader looks at the name of Thorn he/she will think that the city disapeared, was destroyed or something.As Poland was occupied by several German states all Polish cities have a German name but it is very unpolite to use them today. And IMHO this is in violation of NPOV policies.  7:11, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)	0

`::I agree that there is turbelence and a million other processes involved in the flipping of a real coin, and that it would be quite inconceivable for a computer to simulate all of these processes.  But that's boringly obvious.  Why even mention it?::Perhaps ``calculate`` the probability would be a term that communicates my point better?  The probability is a computable number.  These probabilities can be manipulated and composed every which way, without involving random numbers, in what may be called a ``simulation``.  The end result is a discrete probability distribution which is an exact solution, not an outcome or event.::However, a computer cannot produce an exact solution if the probability model involves a poission distribution.::If the coin is biased and the resulting probability is an uncomputable number, this implies that it was biased by an uncomputable number.  But nondimensionalizing solves this problem.  Essentially, we're not really concerned with ``numbers`` when we're talking about a computer.  We're talking, rather, about finite states.  So long as the problem can be coded by a finite number of states, it is discrete, and can be operated on by a turing machine.::The poission distribution is often represented in the form::::::A special case of the poission distribution is the exponential distribution, where the x parameter is 1::::::-  `	0

`I posted this to  because the timeline confused me too.Hey, I tried to clean up the timeline at Vote so it was easier to read and realized I don't know what it's a timeline of. What does it mean when you include the qualifier ``to stand for elections?`` Does that mean in addition to the right to vote? What if the qualifier says ``right to vote``? Also, what is your source? Myanmar was called Burma in 1935, and the FYR of Macedonia did not exist in 1946. I'm pretty sure Croatia, Uzbekistan, Krygyrztan and Kazakhstan did not exist at the time they're on your list as well. What are you referring to? The US is on in 1920, so you're obviously not referring to universal suffrage. You need to explain exactly what this list is talking about, because I had assumed it was universal suffrage.A timeline of the development of voting would be interesting (though it should probably be a separate article), but it needs to be clear at which stages the right was granted to which people (based on sex, race, age, criminal history, political status, etc).  19:26 Oct 21, 2002 (UTC)`	0
